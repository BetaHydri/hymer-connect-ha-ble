# HYMER Connect S600 / S700 Dashboard

A ready-to-use, mobile-friendly Lovelace dashboard is shipped with this integration as [`hymer_connect.yaml`](./hymer_connect.yaml). It uses **only stock Home Assistant tile cards** — no HACS frontend cards required.

> **🚐 Different model? Community dashboards:** Alternative layouts contributed by other users for their specific vehicle live alongside the default one. They use only stock cards too and are a good starting point if your vehicle differs from the Grand Canyon S 600 / S 700:
>
> | Dashboard | Vehicle | Highlights |
> |-----------|---------|------------|
> | [`hymer-bmci-680.yaml`](./hymer-bmci-680.yaml) | **HYMER BMC I 680** (contributed by [@FrankHae](https://github.com/FrankHae)) | 7 views — Basics, Lights, Solar, Heizung/Boiler/Kühlschrank, Fahrzeug, **Satellit** (TenHaaft dish), Karte. Includes the **Alde 3030** heater and the satellite-dish status sensors + On/Off switch. |
>
> Entity IDs are brand-agnostic (`sensor.hymer_*`, `light.hymer_*`), so any of these YAML files import the same way as the default — just point a new dashboard at the file. Adapt the tiles to your own vehicle's fitted components.

## Installation

1. Copy or link [`hymer_connect.yaml`](./hymer_connect.yaml) into your Home Assistant config
2. **Settings → Dashboards → + Add dashboard → From YAML file**, point it at the file
   *or* paste the contents into a new dashboard via **Edit dashboard → Raw configuration editor**
3. **Create the [`Engine Running (Corrected)` template sensor](#-required-engine-running-corrected-template-sensor)** — the dashboard references it on the Vehicle/Doors tabs and those tiles will show *Unavailable* until the helper exists
4. Open the dashboard — all other entities resolve automatically because the integration uses stable, predictable entity IDs (`sensor.hymer_*`, `light.hymer_*`, etc.)

> **Prerequisite**: Home Assistant 2022.11+ for tile card support.

## Dashboard Tabs (9 views)

| Tab | Content |
|-----|---------|
| **Overview** | Battery + water gauges, quick toggles (12V, pump, lock, SCU), thermostat, map |
| **Energy** | Solar production, charge phase, charger active, BMS metrics |
| **Power** | Battery details, 12V/main switch, BMS pack, solar power |
| **Climate** | Truma thermostat, fan speed, energy source select, boiler mode, fridge cooling step |
| **Water** | Fresh + grey water gauges, water pump, EBL diagnostic card |
| **Vehicle** | Model info, fuel/AdBlue, odometer, distance to service, outside temperature, ignition, fuel consumption + range |
| **Doors** | Driver/passenger door state, lock state, parking brake, chassis flags |
| **Lights** | All 8 interior lights + LED bar + the two native SCU group lights |
| **GPS** | Map, coordinates, altitude, satellites, signal quality, heading |
| **System** | SCU + Truma firmware, LTE/BT telemetry, tyre pressure, **SCU restart button** |

## Light Entities (provided by the integration)

Entity IDs are predictable and brand-agnostic — no per-install suffix is needed.

| Entity ID | Light | Features |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| `light.hymer` | Outside LED bar (bus 25) | On/Off, Brightness |
| `light.hymer_living_ceiling` | Living ceiling | On/Off, Brightness |
| `light.hymer_living_ambient` | Living ambient | On/Off, Brightness, Color Temp |
| `light.hymer_kitchen` | Kitchen | On/Off, Brightness |
| `light.hymer_seating_overhead` | Seating overhead | On/Off, Brightness |
| `light.hymer_bedroom_ambient` | Bedroom ambient | On/Off, Brightness, Color Temp |
| `light.hymer_night_light` | Night light | On/Off, Brightness |
| `light.hymer_bathroom_ceiling` | Bathroom ceiling | On/Off, Brightness |
| `light.hymer_bedroom_overhead` | Bedroom overhead | On/Off, Brightness |
| `light.hymer_wohnen_all_lights` | **Native SCU group**: All Wohnen (bus 24) | On/Off, Brightness |
| `light.hymer_privat_all_lights` | **Native SCU group**: All Privat (bus 27) | On/Off, Brightness |

> **Native SCU light groups (since v2.26.0)**: The two `*_all_lights` entities are not Home Assistant `light.group` helpers — they map directly onto the SCU bus 24/27 hardware group endpoints, the same ones the EHG app uses. They are reliable and respond instantly. You do **not** need to create your own HA light groups.

## 12V Main Switch — Availability Guard

When the **12V main switch** is turned off, all light entities and the water pump switch become **unavailable** in Home Assistant. Tile cards automatically gray them out and disable interaction — this prevents sending commands to components that won''t respond without habitation power.

| Entity | 12V Off | 12V On |
|--------|---------|--------|
| All lights (interior + LED bar + groups) | Grayed / unavailable | Active |
| Water pump | Grayed / unavailable | Active |
| 12V main switch | **Always active** | Active |
| Fridge (mode + ECO) | **Always active** | Active |
| Boiler | **Always active** | Active |
| Truma heater | **Always active** | Active |

> The fridge, boiler, and heater operate independently of the habitation 12V circuit.

## Energy Dashboard Integration

The HA [Energy dashboard](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/energy/) requires sensors with specific attributes ([FAQ](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/energy/faq/#troubleshooting-missing-entities)):

| Attribute | Power sensors | Energy sensors |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| `device_class` | `power` | `energy` |
| `state_class` | `measurement` | `total_increasing` |
| `unit_of_measurement` | `W` or `kW` | `Wh` or `kWh` |

The integration provides **power** sensors (W) but not energy sensors (kWh) — convert with HA''s built-in [Riemann Sum](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/integration/) helper.

### Creating a Solar Energy sensor (kWh)

**Option A: HA UI (recommended)**

1. **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers**
2. **+ Create Helper → Integration - Riemann sum integral sensor**
3. Configure:
   - **Input sensor**: `sensor.hymer_solar_power`
   - **Integration method**: Left Riemann sum
   - **Metric prefix**: `k`
   - **Time unit**: Hours
   - **Name**: Hymer Solar Energy

The resulting `sensor.hymer_solar_energy` will have `device_class: energy`, `state_class: total_increasing`, `unit: kWh` — ready for the Energy dashboard.

**Option B: configuration.yaml**

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: integration
    source: sensor.hymer_solar_power
    name: Hymer Solar Energy
    unique_id: hymer_solar_energy
    unit_prefix: k
    unit_time: h
    method: left
```

### Adding to the Energy Dashboard

1. **Energy** (sidebar) → **Configure**
2. Under **Solar Panels**, click **Add solar production**
3. Select `sensor.hymer_solar_energy`

> The Energy dashboard needs several hours of data before charts populate. Allow at least 24 hours after setup.

### Power sensors ready for Individual Devices

Already correctly attributed (`device_class: power`, `state_class: measurement`):

| Sensor | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `sensor.hymer_solar_power` | W | Solar output (voltage × current) |
| `sensor.hymer_heater_electric_power` | W | Truma electric element (0/900/1800 W) |

## ⚠️ Required: Engine Running (Corrected) template sensor

> **The shipped dashboard YAML uses `binary_sensor.hymer_engine_running_corrected` on the Vehicle and Doors tabs. This template sensor does NOT exist out of the box — you must create it manually, or those tiles will show "Unavailable".**

The Mercedes Sprinter CAN bus goes silent when the engine is turned off — without sending a final "off" update. The SCU caches the last received value, so the raw `binary_sensor.hymer_engine` keeps showing **On** while parked. The template below cross-references ignition state and lock state to suppress the stale value.

The earlier helper logic only checked ignition and could still behave poorly during short reconnect gaps. In addition, an availability template can make the helper show **Unavailable** (`Außer Betrieb`) while driving if the ignition entity briefly drops out during a reconnect. The safer approach is to:

- treat `binary_sensor.hymer_vehicle_movement` as a strong positive signal,
- still force **Off** when ignition is `Off`/`Accessory` or the vehicle is locked,
- avoid a custom availability template so the helper stays usable during transient data gaps.

### Create via HA UI (recommended)

**Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → + Create Helper → Template → Template a binary sensor**

- **Name**: `Hymer Engine Running (Corrected)`
- **Device class**: Running
- **Icon**: `mdi:engine`
- **State template**:

  ```jinja
  {% set ignition = states('sensor.hymer_ignition') %}
  {% set moving = is_state('binary_sensor.hymer_vehicle_movement', 'on') %}
  {% set locked = is_state('binary_sensor.hymer_lock', 'on') %}
  {% set engine_raw = is_state('binary_sensor.hymer_engine', 'on') %}
  {% if moving %}
    true
  {% elif ignition in ['Off', 'Accessory'] or locked %}
    false
  {% else %}
    {{ engine_raw }}
  {% endif %}
  ```

- **Availability template**: leave empty / do not set one

### Or add to `configuration.yaml`

```yaml
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: "Hymer Engine Running (Corrected)"
        unique_id: hymer_engine_running_corrected
        device_class: running
        icon: mdi:engine
        state: >
          {% set ignition = states('sensor.hymer_ignition') %}
          {% set moving = is_state('binary_sensor.hymer_vehicle_movement', 'on') %}
          {% set locked = is_state('binary_sensor.hymer_lock', 'on') %}
          {% set engine_raw = is_state('binary_sensor.hymer_engine', 'on') %}
          {% if moving %}
            true
          {% elif ignition in ['Off', 'Accessory'] or locked %}
            false
          {% else %}
            {{ engine_raw }}
          {% endif %}
```

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Vehicle movement is `On` | Engine forced to **On** |
| Ignition is `Off` or `Accessory` | Engine forced to **Off** |
| Vehicle is locked | Engine forced to **Off** |
| Otherwise | Uses the raw `binary_sensor.hymer_engine` value |

After creating the helper, the dashboard's Vehicle/Doors tabs will display the correct engine state automatically — no further changes needed.

If you already created the older helper, edit it and:

1. add the `vehicle_movement` line and `if moving` branch,
2. remove any custom availability template.

> **Tip**: hide the raw `binary_sensor.hymer_engine` via **Settings → Devices & Services → Entities** so it does not clutter the UI.

## Other stale CAN sensors without an obvious override

| Sensor | Why no override |
|--------|-----------------|
| **DPF Status** | Binary status (`Normal`/`Regeneration`), not a soot percentage. `Normal` is correct most of the time; only changes during an active regeneration cycle. The Mercedes service-menu soot percentage is a different CAN signal not exposed by the SCU. |
| **Coolant Temperature** | Drops gradually after engine off; the cached value goes stale slowly but a hard override is not appropriate. |

## Dynamic Slot Discovery (v2.34.0+)

The integration auto-creates a generic, **disabled-by-default** diagnostic sensor (`Discovered bus N slot M`) for every PIA `(bus, slot)` pair the SCU reports that is not already in the named-sensor map.

Useful especially for **non-HYMER EHG brands** (Eriba, Bürstner, Dethleffs, LMC, Niesmann+Bischoff, Sunlight, Carado, Laika, FreeOnTour) where the slot map may have gaps. See the main [README](../README.md#dynamic-slot-discovery-v2340) for details and how to contribute mappings back upstream.
