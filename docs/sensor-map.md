# PIA Sensor Bus Map

> **Primary vehicle:** HYMER Grand Canyon S 600 CrossOver (2025), Mercedes Sprinter 419 CDI
> **SCU Firmware:** 1.12.0.0
> **Validated:** April 2026 via mitmproxy captures + live HA correlation
> **Discovery scan:** 2026-04-23 — 129 sensors, 129 mapped, 0 unmapped. Vehicle-verified at Unterföhring.
> **JSON architecture:** v2.44.0+ — all sensor mappings, entity definitions, lights, and switches loaded from `base.json` + `{brand}.json`.

This document maps every known `(bus_id, sensor_id)` slot to its sensor name,
unit, and value transform. The base map was built on the S600 but includes
additive mappings from other EHG vehicles:

- **Bus 60** (Dometic compressor fridge) — contributed by @mvondemhagen on Eriba Car 602 (#54)
- **Bus 14 / 66** (bedroom ceiling light, dinette pendant lamp) — confirmed by @mcfly1969 on HYMER ML-T 570 CrossOver (#7, 2026-06-01)

Slot assignments are identical on S600 and S700 Grand Canyon models — both use
the same SCU component types and bus IDs (confirmed by @dan-simms1 in [#37](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/37)).
Other EHG brands may differ — see the [Multi-Brand Notes](../README.md#-multi-brand-notes-eriba-bürstner-dethleffs-etc) in the README.

### Dynamic JSON overlays (v2.41.0+, fully JSON-driven since v2.43.0)

Starting with v2.43.0, **all** sensor mappings and entity definitions are loaded
from JSON files in `custom_components/hymer_connect/sensor_maps/`.  The hardcoded
Python `SENSOR_MAP` dict is empty — everything comes from JSON.

At startup the integration loads `base.json` (universal buses shared by all EHG
brands) + `{brand}.json` (brand-specific overlays, e.g. `hymer.json` for S600/S700).

#### JSON file format (v2.43.0+ object format)

Each sensor entry is a JSON object with **decode fields** (how the raw protobuf
value is processed) and optional **entity fields** (how the HA entity is configured):

```json
{
  "_comment": "Description (ignored by loader)",
  "sensors": {
    "1,1": {
      "name": "odometer",
      "unit": "km",
      "transform": "div1000",
      "platform": "sensor",
      "device_class": "distance",
      "state_class": "total_increasing",
      "icon": "mdi:counter"
    },
    "1,10": {
      "name": "engine_running",
      "platform": "binary_sensor",
      "device_class": "running",
      "icon": "mdi:engine"
    },
    "1,8": {
      "name": "vin_text"
    }
  }
}
```

**Decode fields** (how the raw value is processed):

| Field | Required | Description | Examples |
|-------|----------|-------------|----------|
| `name` | **Yes** | Sensor name — becomes the HA entity key and translation key | `"odometer"`, `"bms_voltage"` |
| `unit` | No | HA unit string | `"V"`, `"A"`, `"°C"`, `"%"`, `"W"`, `"km"`, `"bar"`, `"m"`, `"min"`, `"Ah"`, `"h"` |
| `transform` | No | Value transform | `"div10"`, `"div100"`, `"div1000"`, `"div3600"` (seconds → hours) |

**Entity fields** (how the HA entity is configured — all optional):

| Field | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `platform` | `"sensor"` or `"binary_sensor"`. If omitted, the entry is decode-only (value stored in coordinator data but no HA entity created). | `"sensor"`, `"binary_sensor"` |
| `device_class` | HA device class string | `"temperature"`, `"voltage"`, `"current"`, `"door"`, `"running"`, `"power"`, `"lock"` |
| `state_class` | HA state class | `"measurement"`, `"total_increasing"` |
| `icon` | MDI icon | `"mdi:thermometer"`, `"mdi:battery"` |
| `on_value` | Binary sensor only — the raw value that means "on" | `"Open"`, `"On"`, `1`, `true` (default: `true`) |
| `enabled` | Set to `false` to disable the entity by default (user can enable in entity registry) | `false` |

Fields starting with `_` (e.g. `_comment`, `_doc`, `_vehicles`) are ignored by the loader.

> **Backward compat:** The old v2.41/v2.42 array format `["name", "unit", "transform"]` is still accepted for decode-only entries but does not support entity metadata.

#### Available overlay files

| File | Entries | Buses | Loaded when | Purpose |
|------|---------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `base.json` | 63 | 1, 3, 30, 45 | Always (first) | Universal sensors shared by ALL EHG vehicles |
| `hymer.json` | 95 | 8, 11–27, 34, 37, 43–44, 49, 58, 66, 99, 114, 121 | Brand = HYMER | S600/S700: lights, Voltronic solar, Thetford fridge, Truma, BOS BMS, Victron. ML-T 570 CrossOver: bedroom ceiling (bus 14), dinette pendant (bus 66), Dometic compressor fridge (bus 114). |
| `eriba.json` | 33 | 18, 59, 60, 93 | Brand = Eriba | Eriba Car 602: Dometic fridge, shower light, Truma AC, furniture light |
| `buerstner.json` | — | — | Brand = Bürstner | Community-contributed (empty) |
| `dethleffs.json` | — | — | Brand = Dethleffs | Community-contributed (empty) |
| `lmc.json` | — | — | Brand = LMC | Community-contributed (empty) |
| `niesmann-bischoff.json` | — | — | Brand = Niesmann+Bischoff | Community-contributed (empty) |
| `sunlight.json` | — | — | Brand = Sunlight | Community-contributed (empty) |
| `carado.json` | — | — | Brand = Carado | Community-contributed (empty) |
| `laika.json` | — | — | Brand = Laika | Community-contributed (empty) |
| `freeontour.json` | — | — | Brand = FreeOnTour | Community-contributed (empty) |

#### Loading order and precedence

```
1. base.json (universal sensors)         ← 63 entries (buses 1, 3, 30, 45)
2. + {brand}.json (brand-specific)       ← overrides base entries for same (bus, slot)
```

Later entries win — a brand file can override anything in base.

#### How entity creation works (v2.43.0+)

```
JSON "sensors" entry with "platform" field
    ↓
pia_decoder.load_sensor_map() stores in SENSOR_MAP (decode) + ENTITY_DEFS (entity metadata)
    ↓
sensor.py / binary_sensor.py call _build_dynamic_sensors() / _build_dynamic_binary_sensors()
    ↓
HA entity descriptions created from ENTITY_DEFS at setup time
    ↓
Entities appear in HA with correct device_class, icon, state_class, etc.
```

Entries **without** a `platform` field are decode-only — they appear in `coordinator.data["signalr_sensors"]` but don't create an HA entity. This is useful for raw slots that are consumed by computed sensors (e.g. `lithium_soc` is decode-only, consumed by the static `battery_soc` entity which reads from it). It is also the right pattern for slots that feed a **stepped-switch select** (see below) — the select reads from `signalr_sensors.<name>` and writes via its own recipe, so no sensor entity is needed.

## Stepped switch / select driver (v2.63.0+)

The generic `stepped_switch` driver lets you expose any appliance that has a small set of integer steps — fridge cooling 1–5, freezer 1–3, fan speed 1–3, etc. — as a writable `select.*_ctrl` entity **without writing any Python**. Add a block to your brand overlay under `climate.selects.<key>` and reload the integration; an entity called `select.<key>_ctrl` appears.

### When does this fit?

Use the stepped-switch driver when **all** of the following are true:

- The appliance is controlled by **one or a few integer slots** (optionally plus a single bool "power" slot).
- An `Off` state maps to a single integer (commonly `0`) or to "power = False".
- Each non-Off step is a single SCU write (with an optional inter-step delay for "power-on then set level" sequences).

Don't use it for:

- The **Thetford fridge on bus 34** — already shipped as `climate.fridge` (type `thetford_t2000`); leave it as-is.
- The **Truma Combi heater / boiler** — already shipped as `climate.truma_heater` + `select.boiler_mode_ctrl` + `select.heater_energy_ctrl`; the multi-slot Mix/Electric recipes are intentionally code-driven.
- Anything that needs string writes following Truma's `Diesel / Both / Electric` pattern across multiple slots — also code-driven for now.

### JSON schema

Add the entry to the **brand** overlay only (e.g. `sensor_maps/hymer.json`), under the `climate.selects` subsection. The subkey `selects` is reserved — entries under it are NOT loaded into `CLIMATE_DEFS`; they go into `STEPPED_SELECT_DEFS` instead.

```jsonc
"climate": {
  "selects": {
    "fridge_dometic_freezer": {
      "name": "Dometic freezer compartment",   // shown in HA UI (no translation file edit needed)
      "icon": "mdi:snowflake",
      "control_bus": 114,
      "options": ["Off", "1", "2", "3"],       // labels visible to the user; non-Off labels MUST be parseable as int
      "read": {
        "step_sensor": "fridge_dometic_freezer", // signalr_sensors.<name> used to compute current state
        "off_value": 0,                          // step_sensor int value that means "Off" (default 0)
        // Optional: gate "Off" detection on a separate boolean power slot
        // "power_sensor": "fridge_dometic_power",
        // "off_when_power_false": true
      },
      "writes": {
        "off":  [{"sid": 4, "uint": 0}],
        "step": [{"sid": 4, "uint": "$option_int"}]   // $option_int is replaced with int(option), e.g. 1/2/3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A write `step` is a list of one or more steps applied in order. Each step is one of:

| Step shape | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `{"sid": N, "bool": true \| false}` | Send a boolean to slot `(control_bus, N)`. |
| `{"sid": N, "uint": <int> \| "$option_int"}` | Send an unsigned int. `"$option_int"` is replaced with `int(option)` chosen by the user. |
| `{"sid": N, "str": "..."}` | Send a string (used by Truma-style appliances). |
| `{"delay_ms": <int>}` | Sleep before the next step (useful for "power on, then set level" sequences). |

### Worked example — a hypothetical "Thetford as stepped" driver

(Don't actually do this — the existing Thetford driver is already in `climate.fridge` and is more user-friendly; this is here only to show how the recipe shape generalizes.)

```jsonc
"selects": {
  "fridge_thetford_demo": {
    "name": "Thetford fridge (demo)",
    "icon": "mdi:fridge",
    "control_bus": 34,
    "options": ["Off", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5"],
    "read": {
      "step_sensor": "fridge_cooling_step",
      "power_sensor": "fridge_power",
      "off_when_power_false": true
    },
    "writes": {
      "off":  [{"sid": 1, "bool": false}],
      "step": [
        {"sid": 1, "bool": true},
        {"delay_ms": 500},
        {"sid": 3, "uint": "$option_int"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step-by-step: add a new stepped device

1. **Identify the slot** producing the step value. Enable `custom_components.hymer_connect.pia_decoder: debug`, change the appliance in the EHG app, and watch for `Discovered unmapped slot` log lines.
2. **Add a sensor-map entry** in your brand JSON for that slot but **omit the `platform` field**. The decoded value lands in `signalr_sensors.<name>` without creating a sensor entity:

   ```jsonc
   "114,4": { "name": "fridge_dometic_freezer", "icon": "mdi:snowflake" }
   ```

3. **Add the `climate.selects.<key>` entry** following the schema above. The `step_sensor` must match the `name` you used in step 2.
4. **Reload** the integration. A new `select.<key>_ctrl` entity is created automatically — pick steps in HA to confirm the writes round-trip via the SCU.
5. **Add to `CHANGELOG.md`** under your release. No version of the integration is bumped automatically.

### Do I need to edit translation files? (the short answer)

| Adding a … | Edit `sensor_maps/<brand>.json`? | Edit `strings.json` + `translations/en.json`? |
|---|---|---|
| Sensor / binary sensor | Yes | **Yes — both files, in the matching `sensor` / `binary_sensor` section.** Translation key = the JSON `name` field. |
| Light | Yes (`lights` section) | **Yes — both files, in the matching `sensor` section for the underlying brightness/color-temp sub-sensors. The light entity itself uses the `lights` JSON `name`.** |
| Switch | Yes (`switches` section) | **Yes — both files, in the `switch` section.** |
| Existing fridge / heater select (`fridge_mode_ctrl`, `boiler_mode_ctrl`, `heater_energy_ctrl`) | Yes (`climate.fridge` / `climate.truma_heater`) | **Yes — both files, in the `select` section.** |
| **Stepped-switch select (`climate.selects.<key>`)** | **Yes** | **No — the `name` field in the JSON is used directly as the entity display name.** This is the only entity type where translation files can be skipped. |
| Button | Code change | **Yes — both files, in the `button` section.** |

> Rule of thumb: any entity that uses a `_attr_translation_key` in Python requires the dual-file translation entry. The stepped-switch driver intentionally sets `_attr_name` from JSON instead, so it bypasses that requirement.

## Bus 1 — VehicleSignal (Mercedes Sprinter chassis CAN)

> **⚠️ Ignition dependency:** Bus 1 data comes from the Mercedes chassis CAN, which is
> only active when the ignition is in ACC or ON position. With ignition OFF, the SCU
> has no new CAN frames to relay — sensors on this bus (outside temp, fuel, odometer,
> doors, etc.) will show stale/cached values even if the 12V habitation main is on.
>
> **Theory (2026-05-07, unverified):** The SCU appears to cache the last-known CAN
> values and re-sends them on SignalR reconnect / subscription refresh. HA records
> this as a state change (`last-changed` updates), but the value itself may be days
> old. Example: `outside_temperature` showed 25.5 °C with `last-changed` = 15 h ago,
> but actual weather in Munich at that time was far below 25 °C. The 25.5 °C
> was likely cached from a warm afternoon days earlier.
> **Planned verification:** Weekend camping trip — drive with ignition on,
> confirm live temperature, fuel consumption, and estimated range updates.

## Bus 8 — Voltronic MPP260CI (MPPT solar charger)

All 7 slots are solar charger data — same layout on both S600 (MPP260CI) and
S700 (MPP250Duo). Some code labels in `pia_decoder.py` still carry legacy names
from an earlier incorrect sensor map where bus 8 was wrongly labeled as grey
water / ventilation. Solar power is computed as `voltage × current` instead of
reading the raw slot (8, 7) directly.

| Slot | Sensor Name | Unit | Notes |

## Bus 14 — Bedroom ceiling light (ML-T 570 CrossOver, confirmed 2026-06-01)

Not present on Grand Canyon S 600/S 700. Discovered and confirmed on a HYMER ML-T 570 CrossOver by user @mcfly1969 in [#7](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha-ble/issues/7) via the dynamic-discovery diagnostic sensors. Member of the bus 27 *Privat* group — toggling the group also drives this light.

## Bus 22 — Outside LED bar (confirmed at vehicle 2026-04-23)

Previously labelled as fresh water tank. Confirmed at vehicle 2026-04-23: both water tanks were empty but bus 22 showed 88%, matching LED bar brightness on bus 25. Bus 22 is the outside LED bar — same physical light as bus 25 (separate SCU component registration). Sensor entities disabled by default (bus 25 is the primary control channel).

| Slot | Sensor Name | Unit | Notes |
|------|------------|------|-------|
| (22, 1) | `light_led_bar_2` | — | On/off (duplicate of bus 25) |
| (22, 2) | `light_led_bar_2_brightness` | % | Brightness (tracks bus 25 LED bar) |

## Bus 24 — All Wohnen light group

Sending (24,1)=true toggles all living area lights (ceiling, ambient, kitchen, seating). **NOT an individual outside light** — verified 2026-04-22: toggling activates all Wohnen lights.

| Slot | Sensor Name | Unit | Notes |

| (24, 3) | `light_wohnen_group_color_temp` | — | Group color temperature context |

## Bus 25 — Outside LED bar (confirmed via mitmproxy 2026-04-22)

Previously mislabelled as grey water. Mitmproxy capture confirmed the EHG app sends on/off + brightness commands to bus 25 when toggling the LED bar. Issue #46 resolved.

## Bus 27 — All Privat light group (discovered 2026-04-22)

Discovered by `tools/discover_sensors.py`. Same structure as Bus 24 (All Wohnen group). Sending (27,1)=true toggles all bedroom/bath lights. **NOT the outside LED bar** — verified by user: toggling (27,1) activates all private area lights.

| Slot | Sensor Name | Unit | Notes |
|------|------------|------|-------|
| (27, 1) | `light_privat_group` | — | On/off (bool). Toggles all Privat lights |

## Bus 30 — ScuSignals (SCU telemetry, LTE, BT, GPS)

> **Prerequisite:** GPS coordinates (slot 1) require the **"Find-My-RV"** service to be
> enabled in the EHG app under **Mehr → Services und Abonnements** (or **More → Services
> and Subscriptions** in English). Without it, the SCU does not include position data in
> its PIA stream (affects both BLE and cloud paths).

Slot labels verified against EHG app Hermes bundle (APK 2.10.14, decompiled
2026-05-05). Previous mapping incorrectly labelled slots 3-7 as GPS data —
they are actually LTE quality, SCU voltage, and Bluetooth device counts.
GPS position comes only from slot 1; the actual GPS fix/altitude/satellites/
heading are delivered via the REST API, not PIA.

## Bus 37 — VehicleInformation (EHG) / Fridge status readback (PIA)

> **Note:** The EHG app metadata labels this bus as `VehicleInformation` with
> slots `VehicleType` and `VehicleBrand`. However, on the S600, the PIA protobuf
> data on bus 37 carries **fridge mode and status readback**, not vehicle
> identification. The fridge select entity reads `fridge_mode` from here and it
> works correctly. This discrepancy may be a SCU firmware routing difference vs
> the EHG app's component registry.

## Bus 66 — Dinette pendant lamp (ML-T 570 CrossOver, confirmed 2026-06-01)

Not present on Grand Canyon S 600/S 700. Discovered and confirmed on a HYMER ML-T 570 CrossOver by user @mcfly1969 in [#7](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha-ble/issues/7) via the dynamic-discovery diagnostic sensors.

## Bus 99 — BOS LUX LiFePO4 BMS (4×80Ah)

Bus 99 is the BOS LUX LiFePO4 BMS on **both** S600 and S700 — same slot layout.
The old labels (AdBlue, engine torque, fuel range, gear) were incorrect; they
were remnants of an earlier wrong sensor map. Corrected by @dan-simms1 in
[#37](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/37). Legacy code
labels are noted below for historical reference only.

## Power Flow — Understanding the Three Current Sensors

The S600 reports current from three independent measurement points:

```
Solar Panel (19V)
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Voltronic  │  solar_current (bus 8)  → raw panel output
│  MPPT 260CI │  e.g. 2.1 A @ 19.4V = 40.7W
└──────┬──────┘
       │  MPPT converts to battery voltage
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  BOS LUX    │  bms_current (bus 99)   → net flow at battery
│  LiFePO4 BMS│  positive = charging, negative = discharging
│  4×80Ah     │  e.g. +1.54 A (net charge into cells)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  CBE EBL402 │  battery_current (bus 3) → habitation load draw
│  Habitation │  negative = consuming power
│  Controller │  e.g. -0.37 A (SCU, fridge ECU, standby loads)
└─────────────┘
```

**Key relationships:**

- **Solar current** is measured at the panel side (higher voltage, lower
  current). After MPPT conversion the power stays the same but current
  increases at the lower battery voltage.
- **BMS current** is the net result: solar input minus habitation load.
  Positive means the battery is charging.
- **Battery current** (EBL) shows what the habitation system draws.
  This is always negative when loads are connected, even while solar is
  charging — it measures downstream of the battery, not the net flow.

A negative habitation current while BMS current is positive is normal —
the solar more than compensates for the load.

## Computed Fuel Sensors (v2.29.0)

These sensors are **not** read from a CAN bus slot. They are computed by the
coordinator from `(1,1) odometer` and `(1,2) fuel_level` plus the configured
diesel tank capacity (default: 93 L for Sprinter 419/519 CDI).

| Sensor | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `fuel_level_liters` | L | `fuel_level_% × tank_capacity / 100` |
| `fuel_consumption` | L/100km | Trip-based: `(fuel_used_L / distance_km) × 100` |
| `fuel_range_estimated` | km | `fuel_liters / consumption_L100 × 100` |

**Trip tracking logic:**
- A reference point (odometer + fuel %) is stored on first reading
- Consumption is only computed after ≥ 5 km driven (noise filter)
- Refueling auto-detected when fuel level increases > 5% → trip resets
- Sanity bounds: only values between 2–60 L/100km are accepted

**Tank capacity configuration:**
Settings → Integrations → HYMER Connect → Configure → "Diesel tank capacity"
Range: 30–200 L. Common Sprinter values: 71 L (314/316 CDI), 93 L (419/519 CDI standard).

## Bus 114 — Dometic compressor fridge (ML-T 570 CrossOver, confirmed 2026-06-01)

Not present on Grand Canyon S 600/S 700 — those use a Thetford fridge on bus 34/37 instead.
Discovered and confirmed on a HYMER ML-T 570 CrossOver by user @mcfly1969 in
[#7](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha-ble/issues/7) via the dynamic-discovery
diagnostic sensors. **First Dometic compressor fridge ever mapped in this repo.**

| Slot | Sensor Name | Unit | Notes |
|------|------------|------|-------|
| (114, 1) | `fridge_dometic_power` | bool | On/off (writable via `switch.fridge_dometic_power_ctrl`) |
| (114, 2) | `fridge_dometic_silent` | bool | Silent / night mode (writable via `switch.fridge_dometic_silent_ctrl`) |
| (114, 4) | `fridge_dometic_freezer` | step | Freezer compartment level: 0 = Off, 1–3 = step. **Writable in v2.63.0+ via `select.fridge_dometic_freezer_ctrl`** (generic stepped-switch driver, see "Stepped switch / select driver" above). The underlying value still lives in `signalr_sensors.fridge_dometic_freezer` — no separate sensor entity exists. |

**Pending confirmation** (waiting on real-vehicle access from @mcfly1969):

- Slot 3 — expected: cooling step 1–5 for the main fridge compartment. Once confirmed, will be exposed as `select.fridge_dometic_cooling_step_ctrl` reusing the same stepped-switch driver (JSON-only addition).
- Slot 5 — expected: door open/closed (binary, add as `platform: binary_sensor`).
- Slot 7 — expected: warning / error code (int).

No new Python is required for any of these — slot 3 follows the stepped-switch schema, slots 5 / 7 are plain sensors.

## Bus 121 — Victron MultiPlus 12/1600/70 (inverter/charger) — NON-FUNCTIONAL

From EHG app metadata extraction (Dan, April 2026). SCU component 121 = VictronMultiplus.
**No data received** on S600 — even with Victron physically switched ON and entities
entities enabled. The Victron MultiPlus communicates via **VE.Bus** (RS-485), which
is incompatible with the vehicle CAN bus. A Victron Cerbo GX cannot bridge this
either — VE.Bus → VE.Can (250 kbps Victron-proprietary CAN) and VE.Bus → MQTT/Modbus
are supported, but neither VE.Bus nor VE.Can can bridge to the vehicle CAN bus
(different baud rates, protocols, and message structures).

The slot definitions exist in the EHG app metadata, suggesting EHG may have a
proprietary SCU-to-Victron interface (dedicated serial/LIN connection) on certain
vehicle configurations, or these are placeholder definitions that were never
implemented. No data has been observed on this bus on the S600.

All entities disabled by default.
