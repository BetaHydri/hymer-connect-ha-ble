## [2.40.0-alpha.1] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **BLE dual-path pairing (experimental)** — Full BLE pairing pipeline: D-Bus JustWorks bonding via raw messages + introspection XML → TLS 1.1 handshake (AES128-SHA) → PairMobileRequest with Write Without Response + 5ms pacing (matching EHG app's Nordic BLE `.split()` behavior). PairMobileResponse pending vehicle test (ATT 0x0e fix: switched from Write With Response to Write Without Response).
- **Config flow Step 3 — BLE Pairing UI** — Progress spinner with 2-minute retry loop (12 attempts, 8s apart). User presses CONNECTION (Verbindung) on SCU while spinner shows. On failure, creates entry in cloud-only mode.
- **BLE enabled checkbox in Step 2** — Users can choose whether to use BLE for ongoing data or only for initial token pairing. Checkbox also visible in Options (Configure).
- **Reconfigure triggers BLE pairing** — Empty submit re-triggers Step 3 pairing. No need to delete and re-add integration.
- **SCU bonding state check** — Polls `fff40004` characteristic (challenge-response) to detect CONNECTION press. Only available after bonding.
- **Sensor Discovery Tool: multi-brand support & JSON export** — The standalone `tools/discover_sensors.py` now accepts a `--brand` parameter (supports `hymer`, `eriba`, `buerstner`, `dethleffs`, `lmc`, `niesmann-bischoff`, `sunlight`, `carado`, `laika`) so non-HYMER vehicle owners can run sensor discovery against their SCU. Results are auto-exported as a JSON file (`sensor_discovery_<brand>.json`) for easy sharing on GitHub issues. Use `--output <path>` to customize the export path. This is a standalone tool only — no changes to the HA integration code.
- **Robust JWT scanning in token extractor** — `tools/capture_ehg_token.py` now uses generic JWT regex scanning (`eyJ...` pattern) across all request/response bodies, HTTP headers, and WebSocket messages instead of relying on specific JSON keys. Fixes token detection for vehicles where the token is not located under the expected `data.token` key or `ehgAccessToken` WebSocket field. Synced from [hymer-connect-ha#53](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/53).

### Fixed

- **D-Bus pairing agent** — `bleak.pair()` has no agent; `bluetoothctl` blocked in HAOS; `dbus-fast` ServiceInterface annotations fail. Solution: pure raw D-Bus messages with `add_message_handler()` + introspection XML.
- **GATT write pacing** — 1253-byte PairMobileRequest (63 chunks at 20 bytes) overwhelmed SCU NUS RX buffer (ATT error 0x0e). Switched to Write Without Response with 5ms pacing for large payloads (>10 chunks), matching EHG app's Nordic BLE `.split()` behavior. Small payloads use Write With Response.
- **Stale bond recovery** — `BleakClient.unpair()` doesn't clear BlueZ bonds. Now uses D-Bus `Adapter1.RemoveDevice()`. Detects corrupt bonds (bonded + disconnect) and clears automatically.
- **Coordinator/config flow race condition** — `_ble_pairing_in_progress` flag prevents concurrent BLE attempts.
- **Options flow BLE defaults** — Checkbox and address now fall back to `config_entry.data` when `options` is empty.
- **BLE address preserved on bonding rejection** — Only cleared on connection-level failures, not bonding rejection.
- **Bonding retry loop** — Config flow retries bonding 12 times over 2 minutes (was single attempt that failed in ~40ms).

### Security

- **Removed log files from repository** — Log files containing VIN, vehicle URN, and BLE MAC address removed. Added `logs/` to `.gitignore`.
- **Anonymized SCU example** — README example output uses placeholder MAC and SCU ID.

## [2.37.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **BLE pairing protocol — `pair_mobile()` in `ble_client.py`** — Implemented the full SCU mobile-device pairing ceremony over BLE/TLS, matching the EHG app's flow: send `PairMobileRequest` (activation token + confirmation token + device name) → wait for user to press ALLOW on SCU touchscreen → receive `PairMobileResponse` with `remote_access_token` and `remote_access_refresh_token` → send `PairMobileConfirmation(success=true)`. This eliminates the need for the mitmproxy token capture workflow when the HA instance (e.g. RPi4) has BLE hardware and is physically near the vehicle. The protobuf field layout was reverse-engineered by Dan Simms (`dan-simms1/hymer-connect-ha`) in the standalone `hymer_token_tool`.

- **Two-step config flow with QR code activation** — The config flow now mirrors the EHG app's setup process: **Step 1** (Login) collects brand, email, password, and optional EHG refresh token. **Step 2** (Vehicle Activation) collects the QR code activation token text from the vehicle sticker and optionally the SCU Bluetooth MAC address. The QR token is resolved via `GET /api/ehg/v1/vehicles/byToken` to obtain the vehicle URN and SCU URN, which are stored in the config entry for use by the coordinator and BLE client.

- **Protobuf encoding/decoding for PairMobileRequest/Response** — Added minimal protobuf wire-format helpers (varint, length-delimited, string, bool fields) with no external dependency. Field numbers match the decompiled EHG app exactly: `BleProtocol(1) → Request(1/2/3/8) → User.PairMobileDevice(4) → activation_token(1), confirmation_token(2), device_name(3), wait_for_confirmation(4)`. Response decoder extracts `remote_access_token(1)`, `remote_access_refresh_token(2)`, and `confirmation_required(3)` from the `Response.mobilePair(9)` field.

- **`PairMobileResponse` dataclass** — New return type for `ScuBleClient.pair_mobile()` containing `remote_access_token`, `remote_access_refresh_token`, `confirmation_required`, `request_id`, `status`, `timestamp`.

- **`CONF_QR_TOKEN` config key** — New constant for the QR code activation token text input in the config flow.

### Changed

- **Config flow is now two steps** — Previously a single-step login form that created the config entry immediately. Now advances to a vehicle activation step after successful login. The config entry now includes `vehicle_urn`, `scu_urn`, `ble_scu_address`, and `ble_enabled` in the entry data (in addition to the existing auth tokens).

- **Coordinator reads BLE settings from both `data` and `options`** — The `ble_enabled` and `ble_address` properties now check `options` first (user-configurable post-setup), falling back to `data` (set during config flow). This means BLE settings from the config flow are immediately effective without requiring a separate options flow visit.

- **BLE has priority over cloud (SignalR)** — The coordinator's `_async_update_data()` now tries BLE first on every 60-second poll. If BLE connects, SignalR is stopped to avoid duplicate data. If BLE disconnects, the listen loop immediately falls back to cloud SignalR. On the next poll, BLE is retried — if it recovers, SignalR is stopped again. Full failover cycle: BLE → Cloud → BLE.

- **Vehicle activation step is optional** — Cloud-only users can skip Step 2 by leaving both QR code and BLE address empty. The integration falls back to auto-discovering the vehicle at runtime. QR code is required when a BLE address is provided (validation error otherwise).

- **Reconfigure flow** — Added `async_step_reconfigure()` for adding QR code, BLE address, or EHG refresh token to an existing config entry post-setup. Accessible via Settings → Integrations → HYMER Connect → ⋮ → Reconfigure.

- **Auto-pairing in coordinator** — `start_ble()` automatically triggers `pair_mobile()` when no EHG refresh token exists and a QR activation token is in the config data. Gets `confirmationToken` from cloud API, sends `PairMobileRequest` over BLE/TLS, waits for user to press ALLOW, stores the returned refresh token in the config entry.

- **Pairing button instruction** — Config flow, coordinator logs (WARNING level), and BLE timeout errors all instruct the user to press the PAIRING button on the SCU control panel before the first connection, matching the EHG app's UX flow.

- **DEBUG-level BLE logging** — Added debug logging for BLE scan (device count, candidates), GATT connect, UART notifications (byte count), PairMobileRequest frame size, and encrypted payload size. Enable with `logger: logs: custom_components.hymer_connect: debug` for troubleshooting.

- **Manifest updated** — Added `bleak>=0.21.0` to requirements, `bluetooth` to dependencies, bumped version to 2.37.0, documentation and issue tracker URLs point to `hymer-connect-ha-ble`.

### Fixed (hardware testing 2026-04-26)

- **TLS 1.0/1.1 on Python 3.14 / OpenSSL 3.x** — The SCU firmware only speaks TLS 1.0/1.1 with `AES128-SHA`/`AES256-SHA`, but modern HAOS (Python 3.14 + OpenSSL 3.x) disables these legacy protocols by default. Fixed by setting `@SECLEVEL=0` in the cipher string and clearing `OP_NO_TLSv1` / `OP_NO_TLSv1_1` flags. Without this, the TLS handshake fails with `[SSL: NO_PROTOCOLS_AVAILABLE]`.

- **HA BleakClient wrapper compatibility** — Home Assistant wraps `bleak.BleakClient` with `HaBleakClientWrapper`, which does not expose the `get_services()` method. Fixed to use the `.services` property with fallback.

- **BLE bonding before TLS** — The SCU requires OS-level BLE bonding (`client.pair()`) before it will respond to TLS handshakes. Without bonding, the TLS ClientHello is sent but the SCU never replies (20-second timeout). Bonding requires the user to press the CONNECTION button on the SCU control panel first.

- **BLE disconnect on failure** — Previously failed BLE attempts left the GATT connection open, causing `Notify acquired` and `already connected` errors on retry. Now properly calls `disconnect()` before clearing the client reference.

- **Auto-scan BLE enabled** — Providing a QR token in config flow Step 2 now always sets `ble_enabled = True`, even without a MAC address. Previously `bool("")` was `False`, preventing auto-scan from working.

- **BlueZ stale notify acquisition leak** — When `start_notify()` failed (e.g. `[org.bluez.Error.NotPermitted] Notify acquired`), `self._client` was never assigned because it was set *after* `start_notify()`. The coordinator's `disconnect()` found `None` and skipped cleanup, leaking the raw `BleakClient`. BlueZ retained the stale D-Bus notify acquisition, causing every subsequent BLE connect attempt to fail identically — a permanent poison loop. Fixed by wrapping all post-GATT-connect setup in `try/except` that guarantees `client.disconnect()` on any failure. On `Notify acquired`: fully disconnect, wait 1s for BlueZ to settle, then reconnect with a fresh GATT session (one retry, no infinite recursion).

- **BLE bonding requires D-Bus pairing agent** — `bleak.pair()` calls `Device1.Pair()` on D-Bus but does NOT register a pairing agent. BlueZ waits ~8s for an agent response that never comes, then cancels with `AuthenticationCanceled` — even when CONNECTION is pressed on the SCU. Tried `bluetoothctl` subprocess but HAOS already has HA's agent registered (`Failed to register agent object`). Fixed by using `dbus-fast` (shipped with HA Core) to register a temporary `NoInputNoOutput` agent directly on D-Bus, call `Device1.Pair()`, auto-confirm JustWorks requests, then unregister.

- **BLE `unpair()` on connected client kills GATT** — `BleakClient.unpair()` removes the device from BlueZ entirely (`RemoveDevice`), terminating the active GATT session. Then `pair()` fails instantly because there's no connection. Fixed by calling `unpair()` via a temporary `BleakClient` *before* the main `connect()`.

- **Coordinator/config flow BLE race condition** — The coordinator's 60s poll was starting a concurrent BLE `connect()`/`pair()` while the config flow's Step 3 pairing task was mid-bonding. The concurrent `unpair()` killed the active bonding negotiation, causing `InProgress` → `AuthenticationCanceled`. Fixed by adding `_ble_pairing_in_progress` flag — coordinator skips BLE while config flow pairing is active.

- **BLE address cleared on bonding rejection** — The stored BLE address was cleared on every failure, forcing a re-scan even when the address was valid (bonding just needed CONNECTION). Now only clears the address on connection-level failures (timeout, device not found), not on bonding rejection.

### Added

- **Step 3 BLE Pairing UI** — After Step 2 (Vehicle QR + BLE MAC), the config flow shows a progress spinner: *"Waiting for SCU to accept BLE pairing..."*. Background task runs the full BLE ceremony (scan → GATT connect → bonding → TLS → PairMobileRequest). On success, EHG token is stored. On failure, entry is created in cloud-only mode.

- **Reconfigure triggers BLE pairing** — The Reconfigure flow (⋮ → Reconfigure) now routes to the Step 3 BLE pairing spinner when QR token + BLE is enabled and no EHG token was manually provided. Allows retrying BLE pairing without deleting and re-adding the integration.

- **Exponential backoff for BLE failures** — First 5 failures retry at normal 60s poll interval (catches the SCU pairing window). After 5 failures, escalates to 5min/10min/max 15min.

- **D-Bus pairing agent** — `bleak.pair()` has no D-Bus agent; `bluetoothctl` blocked in HAOS; `dbus-fast` ServiceInterface annotations fail at import. Solution: pure raw D-Bus messages with `add_message_handler()` + introspection XML that tells BlueZ the agent supports `RequestConfirmation`, `AuthorizeService`, etc. Auto-accepts all JustWorks callbacks.

- **GATT write pacing** — Large BLE payloads (PairMobileRequest = 1253 bytes = 63 chunks at 20 bytes) overwhelm the SCU's NUS RX buffer, causing `ATT error 0x0e`. Added 10ms inter-chunk delay for writes >10 chunks.

- **Stale/corrupt bond recovery** — After ATT error 0x0e, bond keys become corrupt. SCU rejects GATT with `device disconnected`. Now detects bonded + disconnect → clears stale bond → retries with fresh bonding.

- **BlueZ bond status check** — `_connect_inner()` now checks the `Paired` D-Bus property before calling `unpair()`. Preserves valid bonds, only clears stale/failed ones.

### Credits

- **Dan Simms** (`dan-simms1/hymer-connect-ha`) — The PairMobileRequest/Response protobuf field layout, the BLE pairing ceremony (activation token + confirmation token + SCU touchscreen ALLOW + refresh token minting), and the `hymer_token_tool` RUNBOOK documenting the full 4-step pairing sequence were invaluable for implementing the BLE pairing path in this integration.

## [2.36.6] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Fridge door and heater window contact never updated after initial state** — The PIA protobuf decoder's depth filter (`depth <= 3`) silently dropped real-time SCU push updates for sensors like `fridge_status` (37,2) and `heater_window_switch_closed` (58,14). The initial subscription response nests sensors at depth 2–3 (so the initial "Closed" state was received), but real-time state-change pushes from the SCU arrive at depth 4 and were discarded. Relaxed the filter to accept known `SENSOR_MAP` entries at depth 4 while keeping the phantom-value protection for unknown entries at depth ≥ 4. `binary_sensor.hymer_fridge_door` and `binary_sensor.hymer_heater_window_contact` now update in real time when the physical door/window is opened or closed.

### Added

- **INFO-level logging for fridge door and window contact state changes** — State transitions for `fridge_status` and `heater_window_switch_closed` are now logged at INFO level (e.g. `State change (37,2) fridge_status: 'Closed' → 'Open' (depth=4)`) so changes are visible in the HA log without enabling DEBUG.

## [2.36.5] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **Truma Combi diagnostics now enabled by default** — The three bus-58 diagnostic binary sensors added in v2.35.0 (`binary_sensor.hymer_heater_combi_error`, `binary_sensor.hymer_heater_response_error`, `binary_sensor.hymer_heater_shoreline_connected`) are now enabled by default instead of disabled. Field use confirmed they catch genuine transient SCU/Truma faults (e.g. a 21-second `Combi Error` window observed on 2026-04-24 23:24:42 → 23:26:21) that would otherwise be invisible without per-entity opt-in. The window safety contact (`binary_sensor.hymer_heater_window_contact`) was already enabled by default. Existing installations that explicitly disabled these entities keep their preference; only fresh installs and never-seen entities are affected.
- **Heater Status dashboard card extended** — The default Truma dashboard now surfaces `Combi Error`, `Response Error`, and `Shoreline (230 V)` rows alongside the existing window-contact row, giving a complete at-a-glance Truma health view.
- **Bus 58 documentation rewritten** — `docs/sensor-map.md` now lists every bus-58 slot with both its local sensor key and the EHG canonical name in parentheses. Slots 10/12/13/14 (renamed in v2.35.0) are no longer shown under the obsolete `heater_sensor_*` placeholders. Slot 58:5 is explicitly flagged as a legacy misnomer (the local key `heater_fan_speed` actually reads `water_heater_mode`, the boiler — kept for backwards compat with existing dashboards/history).
- **`sensor.hymer_heater_fan_speed` disabled by default** — This legacy sensor reads slot 58:5 (`water_heater_mode`), which is the boiler mode and is already exposed (and writable) via `select.hymer_boiler_mode_ctrl`. The duplicate sensor is now disabled by default for new installs to avoid confusion. Existing installs keep their current state (enable/disable) — manually disable it in the entity registry if you want it gone.

## [2.36.4] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **`binary_sensor.hymer_dinette_window_diesel_safety` showed `Geöffnet` while the window was actually closed** — Slot 58:14 was added in v2.35.0 with `on_value=False` based on the misleading EHG metadata name `window_switch_closed`. Captured traces (six `ws_capture_*.jsonl` files) prove the opposite: the slot's resting state is `false` while the window is closed, and it flips to `true` when the dinette window is opened (one capture at 2026-04-19 15:23:58 shows the live `false → true → false` transition). So the raw value already matches HA's WINDOW device-class semantics (`True = open`). Removed the `on_value=False` inversion.

## [2.36.3] - 2026-04-24

### Removed

- **`select.hymer_heater_mode`** — The Heater Mode select (Off/Normal/Automatic) backed by slot 58:11 (`heater_air_mode`) was removed. Investigation against captured SignalR traffic (six `ws_capture_*.jsonl` sessions across three days) and the decoded mitm `.flow` files showed:
  1. The official EHG app exposes **no** heater-mode control on the Klima tab — only heating on/off + setpoint, electric aux wattage, energy source, boiler on/off, and Turbo mode.
  2. Slot 58:11 was **never** written to by the EHG app in any captured trace — the only bus-58 writes observed were 58:5 (`water_heater_mode`) paired with 58:4 (`heater_fuel_type`).
  3. Slot 58:11 was always read as `"Normal"` in every capture; v2.36.1's pairing-with-fuel-slot fix did not change SCU behavior.
  This matches the situation already documented for the heater fan slot in v2.36.0: the EHG metadata `rw` flag is a per-firmware capability hint, not a guarantee, and the Truma firmware silently reverts unsupported writes. The reading is still available via `sensor.hymer_heater_operating_mode`.
- Heater Mode tile removed from the dashboard.
- Translation entries for `heater_air_mode_ctrl` removed.

## [2.36.2] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Dashboard "Fan Speed" mirrored Boiler Mode** — The Heater Status card showed a `Fan Speed` row backed by `sensor.hymer_heater_fan_speed`, but that sensor reads slot 58:5 which is `water_heater_mode` (the boiler). So toggling the boiler to ECO made the row read `Eco`, looking like the heater fan was responding when it wasn't. Removed the misleading row from the dashboard. The underlying sensor entity is left in place for backwards compatibility but is no longer surfaced on the default dashboard. The real Truma fan power (Eco/High) is not exposed on the SCU bus and remains panel-only.

## [2.36.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Heater mode reverted to `Normal` after selecting `Automatic`** — Standalone `set_value` writes to slot 58:11 were silently rolled back by the SCU. Switched the Heater Mode select to a multi-sensor command paired with the fuel slot (58:4), matching the pattern every other writable 58:* slot uses (setpoint, boiler mode, energy source). Captured EHG traffic always pairs writes on bus 58 this way.

## [2.36.0] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Climate fan_mode was actually controlling the boiler** — The Truma climate entity exposed an `Eco`/`High` fan mode that wrote to slot 58:5, but per EHG metadata that slot is `water_heater_mode` (the boiler), not a heater fan-speed slot. Selecting `High` on the climate card was silently turning the **boiler** to `HOT` while doing nothing to the heater fan. Removed `FAN_MODE` from the climate entity's supported features and the `Vent` HVAC mode (the SCU bus has no writable fan-speed slot — the 1–10 numeric vent steps and the panel `VENT` mode are physical-panel only).

### Added

- **Heater mode select** (`select.hymer_heater_mode`) writing to slot 58:11 (`heater_air_mode` per EHG metadata). Options: `Off` / `Normal` / `Automatic`. This is the actual heater on/off/auto mode toggle on the SCU bus.
- Heater Mode tile on the Heating dashboard, next to Boiler Mode.
- Translation entries for `heater_air_mode_ctrl` and the previously-missing `heater_energy_ctrl`.

## [2.35.2] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Truma fan mode `High` was silently ignored** — The climate handler was writing the literal string `"High"` to bus 58 slot 5, but the SCU only accepts the EHG-canonical values `OFF` / `ECO` / `HOT` (per the EHG app metadata). The write was accepted on the wire but the panel kept showing `Eco`. Now writes `"HOT"` for the `High` HA fan_mode option, matching what the OEM app sends.

## [2.35.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Truma fan mode `NameError`** — `climate.async_set_fan_mode` referenced an undefined `fuel` variable, causing every Eco/High/Vent change to fail with `NameError: name 'fuel' is not defined`. Now resolves the current air energy source via `_get_fuel_type()` before sending the multi-sensor command, matching the pattern used by `async_set_hvac_mode` and `async_set_temperature`.

## [2.35.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Truma Combi window safety contact** — New `binary_sensor.hymer_heater_window_contact` exposes the window switch on the dinette window where the Truma diesel exhaust is routed. When the window is open the SCU automatically blocks the diesel heater (safety interlock); the entity uses HA's `WINDOW` device class so dashboards/automations can react instantly. Source: bus 58 sid 14 (`window_switch_closed`) per EHG app metadata.
- **Truma Combi diagnostics** — Three additional diagnostic binary sensors (disabled by default): `heater_combi_error`, `heater_response_error`, `heater_shoreline_connected`. Sources: bus 58 sids 10/12/13 per EHG app metadata.
- **Bus 58 slot annotations** — All 11 mapped slots on bus 58 now carry inline comments naming their canonical EHG meaning (`TrumaCombi_DE` component) so future contributors do not have to re-derive them.

### Changed

- **Renamed 4 placeholder slots on bus 58** (no entity bindings, safe rename): `heater_sensor_10` -> `heater_combi_error`, `heater_sensor_12` -> `heater_response_error`, `heater_sensor_13` -> `heater_shoreline_connected`, `heater_sensor_14` -> `heater_window_switch_closed`. The previously confusing `heater_sensor_14` users may have seen via v2.34.0 dynamic discovery is now a properly named binary sensor. Existing entities (`heater_setpoint`, `heater_state`, `heater_fuel_type`, `heater_fan_speed`, `heater_electric_power`, `heater_operating_mode`) are unchanged to preserve dashboards and history, but their canonical EHG names are documented in code comments for clarity.

## [2.34.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Dynamic slot discovery** — Any PIA `(bus_id, sensor_id)` pair reported by the SCU that is not present in `SENSOR_MAP` now automatically appears as a generic diagnostic sensor named `Discovered bus N slot M` (entity id `sensor.hymer_discovered_bus{N}_slot_{M}`). Entities are **disabled by default** so they do not pollute the UI — enable them via the entity registry to inspect the raw value reported by an unknown slot. This brings the discovery capability of `tools/discover_sensors.py` directly into Home Assistant, making it easier to identify what unmapped slots actually report when you trigger physical actions on the vehicle. Existing 129 named entities are unaffected (the decoder only emits fallback `bus{N}_s{M}` keys for slots NOT in `SENSOR_MAP`).

## [2.33.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **12V main switch ON flicker** — The verify timer now waits 30s (was 15s) for the main switch, matching the existing OFF holdoff. The SCU reboots on any 12V state change and pushes a stale "Off" readback during reconnect. The old 15s verify fired too early, falsely declared the SignalR send channel dead, forced a reconnect, and left the dashboard stuck on "Aus" even though the vehicle's 12V was actually ON. The fix suppresses this flicker by holding the optimistic state through the SCU reboot window.
- **Case-insensitive readback comparison** — The switch verify check now uses case-insensitive string matching, consistent with the binary sensor fix in v2.32.0.

## [2.33.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **SCU Restart button** — New `button.hymer_restart_scu` entity sends a cold reboot command to the Smart Control Unit. Useful when the SCU is stuck or not responding to commands. Located in the System tab with a confirmation prompt ("Are you sure?"). The integration auto-reconnects after reboot (~30-60s). Credit: Dan Simms decoded the `Request.command.restart` PIA protocol path.

### Fixed

- **Shutdown-safe SignalR** — The coordinator now marks itself as shutting down before tearing down the SignalR connection. Reconnect attempts during HA shutdown/unload are suppressed, eliminating the `Session is closed` log noise that appeared on every HA restart.

## [2.32.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Fridge door binary sensor** — New `binary_sensor.hymer_fridge_door` with `BinarySensorDeviceClass.DOOR`. Reads `fridge_status` (bus 37, sid 2) which the SCU reports as int 0/1, mapped to "Open"/"Closed" by the PIA decoder. Previously only exposed as a text sensor that stayed stuck on "Closed". Dashboard updated to use the new binary sensor.

### Fixed

- **Case-insensitive `is_on` for string-based binary sensors** — The `is_on` comparison now uses case-insensitive string matching for all string-valued binary sensors (doors, lock, main switch, chassis flags). Previously, if the SCU sent `"ON"` instead of `"On"`, the sensor would silently show the wrong state. Credit: Dan Simms' metadata-driven implementation (`dan-simms1/hymer-connect-ha`) uses device-class-aware string matching sets (`_DOOR_TRUE_VALUES`, `_CONNECTIVITY_TRUE_VALUES`, etc.) which highlighted this fragility in our per-entity `on_value` approach.
- **Vehicle Bus Architecture documentation** — Added comprehensive README section covering CAN/LIN bus topology, dual-path BLE/LTE control architecture, Mermaid diagram, and bus summary table.

## [2.31.0] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **Dashboard engine entity** — Corrected entity ID from `binary_sensor.hymer_engine_running` to `binary_sensor.hymer_engine` (HA-generated ID). Dashboard and template helper now work correctly.
- **Fridge door sensor** — Confirmed (37,2) IS a door sensor (EHG app shows open/closed). HA entity doesn’t update — suspected decoder depth filter issue, needs mitmproxy capture.
- **Documentation** — Updated README (LED bar, native groups, ~130 entities, door sensors corrected), sensor-map (bus 22 = LED bar, bus 121 Victron, door verification notes).

## [2.30.2] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **Removed orphan rear door entity** — `binary_sensor.hymer_rear_door` referenced a dead path (`signalr_sensors.door_rear`) after slot (1,14) was renamed to `motor_oil_warning`. Confirmed at vehicle: (1,14) = SNA (not connected on S600). Rear doors only available via Mercedes ME API.

## [2.30.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **Bus 22 is LED bar, not fresh water** — Confirmed at vehicle: both water tanks were empty but bus 22 showed 88%, matching LED bar brightness on bus 25. Bus 22 is a duplicate LED bar SCU component. Sensor renamed and disabled by default. Dashboard water sensors remain on EBL (bus 3).

### Confirmed at vehicle (2026-04-23)

- **Door sensors**: Only driver (1,12) and passenger (1,13) doors have PIA sensors. Sliding side door and rear barn doors are CAN-bus only (Mercedes ME API).
- **Motor oil warning (1,14)**: Shows "SNA" (Sensor Not Available) — not connected on S600.
- **No Victron bus 121**: Not detected with current Victron switch state. Entities remain disabled.
- **No Truma ventilation**: EHG app only supports heating mode, not fan-only ventilation (issue #38 — won’t fix).

## [2.30.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Victron MultiPlus 12/1600/70 support** — Bus 121 sensor mapping (19 slots) from EHG app metadata extraction. Includes inverter state/voltage/current/frequency, charger state/voltage/current, shore power input, device failure status, and firmware version. All entities disabled by default — enable in Settings > Entities when Victron physical switch is ON.
- **Victron binary sensors** — `victron_inverter_on` and `victron_charger_on` for inverter/charger power state monitoring.

## [2.29.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Fuel level in liters** — Computed sensor `fuel_level_liters` converts fuel level percentage to absolute liters using the configured tank capacity.
- **Fuel consumption (L/100km)** — Computed sensor `fuel_consumption` tracks diesel usage from odometer + fuel level deltas. Resets on refueling (>5% fuel increase). Requires minimum 5 km driven.
- **Estimated range** — Computed sensor `fuel_range_estimated` calculates remaining driving range in km from current fuel and consumption rate.
- **Configurable diesel tank capacity** — Options flow allows users to set their diesel tank size (30–200 L, default 93 L for Sprinter 419/519 CDI). Go to Settings > Integrations > HYMER Connect > Configure.
- **Dashboard fuel section** — Diesel gauges and fuel entities card added to the Vehicle tab.

## [2.28.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **EBL402 water tank sensors** — Bus 3 slots (3,8) and (3,9) renamed from `light_1_level`/`light_2_level` to `fresh_water_level_ebl`/`grey_water_level_ebl`. These are the EBL402's built-in tank level inputs (per Dan's S700 PR #44). Direct percentages, no invert.

### Removed

- **Grey water sensor from bus 25** — Bus 25 is the LED bar (confirmed v2.27.0), not grey water. Old `gray_water_level` sensor entity removed.

### Changed

- **Dashboard water gauges** — Updated to use new EBL402 water sensors instead of the old bus 22/25 mappings.

## [2.27.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Outside LED bar light entity (Bus 25)** — Confirmed via mitmproxy capture: the EHG app sends on/off + brightness commands to bus 25 when toggling the LED bar. Issue #46 resolved!

### Fixed

- **Bus 25 was grey water, not LED bar** — Mitmproxy capture proved bus 25 is the outside LED bar. Grey water sensor removed from bus 25.
- **Fresh water invert100 transform removed** — Bus 22 raw values are direct percentages (empty tanks show ~15 raw ≈ <10% in EHG app). The invert100 transform was producing incorrect 85% readings for empty tanks.

## [2.26.0] - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- **Native SCU light groups replace HA groups** — Bus 24 (All Wohnen) and Bus 27 (All Privat) are hardware group controls built into the SCU. One command toggles all lights in each group at the hardware level — faster and more reliable than HA light groups.

### Fixed

- **Bus 24 was not an outside light** — Corrected from individual outside light to All Wohnen group control (verified: toggling activates all living area lights)
- **Bus 27 was not the LED bar** — Corrected from LED bar to All Privat group control (verified: toggling activates all bedroom/bath lights)
- **Outside LED bar bus ID still unknown** — Issue #46 remains open. The LED bar is not in the 129 discovered sensor buses.

## [2.25.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Outside LED bar light entity** — Discovered Bus 27 as the outside LED bar via the new `discover_sensors.py` tool. Adds a controllable light entity with on/off and brightness (bus 27, sensor IDs 1-3). EHG app supports on/off + brightness for this light.
- **Sensor discovery tool** (`tools/discover_sensors.py`) — Standalone script that connects to the SCU via the cloud, subscribes to all PIA data, and outputs a complete (bus_id, sensor_id) mapping table with mapped/unmapped status. Discovered 129 sensors, 126 mapped, 3 unmapped.
- **EHG token capture scripts** (`tools/capture_ehg_token.py`, `tools/Start-EhgTokenCapture.ps1`) — Simplified one-click proxy for capturing the EHG refresh token. Windows launcher auto-installs prerequisites.

### Documentation

- Updated sensor map (`docs/sensor-map.md`) with Bus 27 LED bar mapping and full discovery scan results
- Updated README with simplified token capture guide, cross-platform instructions, and prerequisites table

## [2.24.0] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- **Duplicate WebSocket connections cause ghost connection state** — When Azure SignalR closes the connection (token expiry, server recycling), the connection-lost callback and the coordinator poll could race to reconnect simultaneously, creating two parallel WebSocket connections with double the traffic. Azure would then throttle or drop one, leaving a "ghost" connection that appears alive (pings succeed, data flows) but silently drops all commands. Added an `asyncio.Lock` to serialize reconnection attempts so only one connection is ever created.

## [2.23.2] - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- **Reduce HA error log noise from expected SignalR reconnections** — Downgraded routine WebSocket close and listen-loop-ended messages from WARNING to INFO level. Only actual WebSocket errors remain at WARNING. Azure SignalR periodically closes connections (token expiry, server-side recycling); the client reconnects automatically and these events are not user-actionable.

## [2.23.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **SCU data goes stale after 3 minutes** — The SCU stops pushing sensor data without periodic prodding. Restored a lightweight refresh command (1 message) every 60s poll to keep data flowing, while keeping the full 7-subscription resubscribe at every 10 min. Traffic: ~108 messages/hour (vs 480 pre-v2.23.0, vs 48 in v2.23.0 which was too low).

## [2.23.0] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **SignalR connection drops due to excessive traffic** — Reduced PIA resubscribe frequency from every 60 seconds to every 10 minutes; the SCU pushes state changes automatically, resubscribe only refreshes slow-changing values (battery SOC, solar current). This cuts outbound traffic from ~480 to ~48 messages/hour, preventing server-side disconnects.
- **SignalR reconnection stuck in exponential backoff** — After 5 consecutive connection failures, forces an OAuth2 token refresh and resets backoff instead of silently retrying every 15 minutes.
- **Race condition in connection-lost handler** — Replaced `call_soon_threadsafe` with direct `async_create_task` since the listen loop already runs on the HA event loop; prevents silently swallowed reconnect errors.
- **Potential infinite 401 retry loop** — Added recursion guard to API `_request()` to prevent endless token refresh cycles when the refresh token itself is expired.

### Changed

- **Reconnect backoff logging** — Upgraded from debug to warning level so reconnect-skipped events are visible in HA logs with attempt count.

## [2.22.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **12V main switch availability guard** — All light entities and the water pump switch become unavailable in HA when the 12V main switch is off, preventing interaction with components that won't respond without habitation power. The main switch itself, fridge, boiler, and heater remain controllable regardless of 12V state.

### Documentation

- **Energy Dashboard setup guide** — Step-by-step instructions for creating a Solar Energy (kWh) sensor from `solar_power` (W) using HA's Riemann Sum helper, plus guidance on which sensors are compatible with the Energy dashboard and their required attributes

## [2.21.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **`bt_connected` → `scu_flag_5`** — slot 30/12 is not BT connected (phones were remote while value was `True`); reverted to unknown flag pending identification

## [2.21.0] - 2026-04-21

### Changed

- **SCU diagnostic sensors renamed** — bus 30 slots 8-14 renamed from generic `gps_sensor_N` to descriptive names based on observed S600 values and S700 mapping (unconfirmed best-guess, pending vehicle validation):
  - `(30, 8)` → `scu_flag_1` — unknown flag (observed: `False`)
  - `(30, 9)` → `lte_connected` — likely LTE connection state (observed: `True`)
  - `(30, 10)` → `scu_flag_2` — unknown flag (observed: `False`)
  - `(30, 11)` → `paired_bt_devices` — likely paired BT device count (observed: `3`)
  - `(30, 12)` → `bt_connected` — likely BT device connected (observed: `True`)
  - `(30, 13)` → `scu_flag_3` — unknown flag (observed: `False`)
  - `(30, 14)` → `scu_flag_4` — unknown flag (observed: `False`)

## [2.20.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **GPS UTC time sensor** — `sensor.hymer_gps_utc_time` (bus 30, slot 2) exposes SCU internal time
- **SCU diagnostic sensors (bus 30, slots 8-14)** — 7 new sensors (`SCU slot 30/8` through `30/14`) disabled by default; enable to discover potential LTE/SCU telemetry data

## [2.19.3] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **Remote-access commands stop working after ~30 minutes** — Periodic `UpdateTokens` refresh every 15 min
- **Components not controllable after 12V ON** — Auto re-auth on SCU reconnect (`scu_connected` false→true)

## [2.18.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Shore power binary sensor** — `binary_sensor.hymer_shoreline_connected` (bus 3, sid 22, EBL 402)

### Changed

- **`switch_22` → `shoreline_connected`** — renamed in PIA decoder

## [2.17.0] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **SignalR auto-recovery after 12V toggle** — optimistic `main_switch` update prevents standby bypass from blocking reconnect; 30-min safety cap added (fixes #46)

## [2.16.0] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **(1,11) and (1,14) remapped** from doors to vehicle warnings per S700 PR #44
- **Dashboard: Vehicle Warnings section** added, Doors cleaned up

## [2.15.2] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Discovery logging for unmapped PIA sensors** — enable via logger config at `info` level

### Fixed

- **Dashboard cleanup** — removed stale entity references, BMS Time Remaining

## [2.15.1] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **S600 door mapping corrected (take 2)** — v2.15.0 had the swap reversed. Correct mapping:
  - (1,12) = `door_driver`, (1,13) = `door_passenger`
  - (1,11) `door_sliding` and (1,14) `door_rear` don't update on S600

## [2.15.0] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **SignalR auto-reconnect on connection loss** — when the WebSocket listen loop ends unexpectedly, the coordinator now triggers an immediate reconnect (resets backoff, schedules refresh) instead of waiting up to 15 minutes for the next poll + exponential backoff cycle. Fixes the issue where the integration became unresponsive after a connection drop and required manual reload.
- **Light/switch/climate/select commands auto-reconnect** — all controllable entities now attempt to reconnect SignalR before sending a command. If reconnection fails, a `HomeAssistantError` is raised with a user-visible toast message instead of silently failing.
- **S600 door sensor mapping corrected** — confirmed at vehicle (2026-04-20):
  - (1,11) `door_driver` → `door_passenger` — physically tested
  - (1,12) `door_passenger` → `door_sliding` — physically tested
  - (1,13)/(1,14) do not update on S600 (no rear door sensors via SCU)

### Added

- **Truma heater energy source: 5 modes** matching physical Truma Combi panel:
  - Diesel (FUEL), Mix 900W (MIX 1), Mix 1800W (MIX 2), Electric 900W (EL 1), Electric 1800W (EL 2)
- **VENT fan mode read-only display** — when VENT is set on the physical Truma panel, HA shows `fan_mode: Vent` and `hvac_action: Fan`
- **`on_connection_lost` callback** in `HymerSignalRClient`

### Changed

- **Heater energy select labels** — renamed to match Truma panel display
- **`heater_fan_speed` value labels** — added VENT mapping

## [2.14.0] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Stale SignalR send channel auto-detection** — after sending a switch command, verify SCU readback after 15s. If the readback doesn't match the commanded state, the connection is marked as dead and the coordinator reconnects automatically on the next poll. Fixes recurring issue where commands appeared to send but SCU ignored them.
- **SignalR send error handling** — `send_pia_request` now catches send exceptions and marks the connection as dead instead of silently failing.
- **Dashboard: removed stale `current_gear` entity** from Vehicle tab (remapped to `bms_state_of_health` in v2.12.0).

## [2.13.0] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **Dashboard: BMS section moved to Power tab** — removed duplicate from Vehicle tab
- **Dashboard: current sensor labels clarified** — "Load Draw" (EBL), "Net Battery Current" (BMS)
- **Diagnostic sensors for EBL slots (3,8) and (3,9)** — temporary sensors to verify if these are water levels (compare with bus 22/25)

### Documentation

- **Power Flow diagram** added to sensor-map.md explaining Solar → BMS → EBL current relationship
- **Bus 3 annotations corrected** — (3,8)/(3,9) flagged as unverified "light levels", likely water levels
- **Bus 8 labels corrected** — all 7 slots are Voltronic MPPT solar data, not water/vents/tire

## [2.12.0] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Bus 99 remapped to BOS LUX BMS** — bms_voltage, bms_current, bms_temperature, bms_time_remaining, bms_state_of_health, bms_capacity_remaining (fixes #14)

## [2.11.0] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Bus 1 slots 2, 5, 9 remapped** — speed→fuel_level, rpm→distance_to_service, coolant_temp→outside_temperature (fixes #16)

## [2.10.1] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **SignalR stays alive during 12V standby** — Dead-connection detector skips recycling when main_switch="Off" (fixes #45)
- **12V switch confirmation dialog** — Bidirectional toggle confirmation
- **Dashboard Standheizung entity IDs** — Fixed to match HA translation-based IDs

## [2.10.0] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Bus 1 slots 17-22 remapped** — Were vehicle lights, actually chassis state flags (parking brake, aux heater, cruise control, etc.). Confirmed by (1,18)="ON" while parked = parking brake

### Removed

- **Vehicle light binary sensors** — headlamp, high_beam, parking_light, fog_front, fog_rear, turn_signal removed (mislabelled)

### Added

- **Chassis state sensors** — parking_brake, standheizung_available/state, cruise_control_can, downhill_assist, coolant_warning

## [2.9.9] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **12V switch OFF holds state through SCU reconnection** — 30s holdoff prevents stale "On" readback from overwriting commanded OFF (fixes #40 for 12V switch)

## [2.9.8] - 2026-04-19

### Changed

- **Dashboard redesigned with clear visual hierarchy** — Section headers, controls, and status tiles are now visually distinct

## [2.9.7] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **Fridge status shows door state** — Labels changed to Open/Closed matching EHG app
- **Energy Source dashboard tile** — Corrected entity ID to `select.hymer`
- **Fresh water level inverted** — 100% when empty fixed (fixes #43)
- **Grey water level inverted** — Same inversion fix (fixes #41)

## [2.9.0] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **12V main switch now works** — Switch sends `str_value="On"/"Off"` instead of `bool_value` (fixes #39)

### Added

- **Heater energy source select** — Diesel / Both 900W / Both 1800W / Electric (fixes #42)
- **String value support for switch commands**
- **Modern tile-based dashboard**

## [2.8.8] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Refresh command after subscription** — Sends a PIA poll/refresh command (field 9) after subscribing to sensor data, matching the EHG app's "aktualisiere" behavior. This forces the SCU to re-report all current states including correct light on/off values, fixing stale cached states after HA restart

## [2.8.7] - 2026-04-19

### Changed

- **Fridge ECO is now a separate switch** — `switch.hymer_fridge_eco_ctrl` (Leise) is an independent toggle that can be enabled on top of any cooling step, matching the EHG app behavior. Previously ECO was a mutually exclusive option in the select dropdown
- **Fridge select simplified** — Options are now Off/1/2/3/4/5 only. ECO removed from the dropdown since it's an overlay, not a mode
- **Dashboard** — Fridge section now shows: Cooling Step (Kühlstufe) select, Quiet Mode (Leise) toggle, Door (Tür) status — matching the EHG app layout

## [2.8.6] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **Fridge command timing** — Added 500ms delay between power-on and cooling step commands to give the SCU time to process. Removed unnecessary ECO-off command when setting cooling steps (matching EHG app behavior)

## [2.8.5] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Heater fan speed control (experimental)** — Fan mode Eco/High available in the Truma heater climate entity. This sends `bus=58, sid=5` with `ECO` or `High` string values. Note: the EHG app does NOT expose this control — use at your own risk. Test at the vehicle before relying on it
- **Thermostat card Heat/Off buttons** — Added explicit HVAC mode feature to the dashboard thermostat card

## [2.8.4] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **Dashboard entity ID alignment** — Fixed 14 entity IDs in the dashboard that didn't match HA's auto-generated names from translation keys (e.g. `sensor.hymer_battery_soc` → `sensor.hymer_battery_level`, `sensor.hymer_coolant_temp` → `sensor.hymer_coolant_temperature`, `binary_sensor.hymer_lock_status` → `binary_sensor.hymer_lock`)

## [2.8.3] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **Clean entity IDs** — Device name simplified from `HYMER HYMER Connect (HYMER)` to `HYMER`, producing clean entity IDs like `sensor.hymer_battery_voltage` instead of `sensor.hymer_hymer_connect_hymer_battery_voltage`. **Requires removing and re-adding the integration for existing installations**
- **Dashboard** — All entity references updated to use clean `hymer_` prefix

## [2.8.2] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **Fridge select auto-powers on** — Selecting a cooling step (1-5) or ECO now automatically powers on the fridge first (bus 34, sid 1). Selecting Off disables ECO and powers off. Previously the fridge stayed off because only the cooling step was sent without the power-on command

## [2.8.1] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **Outside light** — Moved from switch (bus 25) to proper light entity (bus 24) with brightness and color temperature control, matching all other interior lights
- **Removed duplicate** — Outside light no longer appears in both Lights and Controls sections of the dashboard
- **Bus 25 sensor** — Reverted bus 25 sid 1 back to grey water sensor (was incorrectly mapped as outside light)

## [2.8.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Climate entity for Truma heater** — `climate.truma_heater` with ON/OFF and target temperature (5-30°C). Sends multi-sensor PIA commands (setpoint + fuel type) matching the official EHG app protocol
- **Select entity for fridge mode** — `select.fridge_mode_ctrl` with options: Off, 1-5 (cooling steps), ECO. Controls bus 34 sensors (sid 1=power, sid 2=ECO, sid 3=cooling step)
- **Select entity for boiler mode** — `select.boiler_mode_ctrl` with options: Off, ECO, Turbo. Sends bus 58 sid 5 with values OFF/ECO/HOT + fuel type
- **Outside light switch** — `switch.outside_light_ctrl` on bus 25, sid 1
- **Multi-sensor PIA command builder** — `build_multi_sensor_command()` in pia_decoder.py supports string and float protobuf fields for heater/boiler commands
- **New Controls view** in dashboard with all switches

### Fixed

- **Water pump switch** — Corrected from bus 22/sid 1 to bus 3/sid 3 (confirmed via mitmproxy capture)
- **Sensor map** — Bus 34 correctly mapped as fridge control (sid 1=power, 2=ECO, 3=cooling step), bus 25 as outside light
- **Heater fan speed labels** — Added "HOT" → "Hot" mapping for boiler turbo mode

### Removed

- **Heater switch** — Replaced by the new climate entity which provides proper thermostat controls

### Changed

- **Dashboard Climate view** — Replaced sensor-only heater display with thermostat card, boiler select, and fridge select controls

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Switch platform** — New controllable switch entities for 12V Main switch (bus 3), Water pump (bus 22), and Heater (bus 34). Uses the same PIA protobuf command structure as lights. Includes optimistic state with SCU confirmation

## [2.6.4] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **Charge phase always showing "Bulk"** — The EBL controller reports its last known charge phase even when no charging is active. The sensor now shows "Idle" when neither solar nor mains charger is actively charging, and only displays the real phase (Bulk/Absorption/Float) during actual charging

## [2.6.3] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **DPF status is a status flag, not a percentage** — Reverted `%` unit added in v2.6.2. The SCU reports DPF as a binary status (0/1), not a soot load percentage. Added human-readable labels: `0` = "Normal", `1` = "Regeneration"

## [2.6.2] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **DPF status missing unit** — Added `%` unit to DPF status sensor in PIA decoder and sensor definition. The Mercedes CAN bus reports DPF soot load as a percentage of maximum capacity

### Added

- **Stale CAN sensor workaround documentation** — Added dashboard README section with HA template sensor workarounds for stale cached CAN values (engine running, speed, RPM, engine torque) and known limitations (DPF status, coolant temperature)

## [2.6.1] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- **Solar/sensor data going stale** — Reverted resubscription throttle from 5min back to every poll (60s). The SCU only pushes fresh sensor data in response to subscription requests — throttling resubscriptions caused sensors like solar voltage/current to show outdated values

## [2.6.0] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- **Stale data / silent disconnection** — SignalR WebSocket connections silently died when the Azure token expired (~1h) and reconnection could fail indefinitely without backoff, leaving the dashboard stuck on stale data until HA reboot
- **Excessive API calls** — REST metadata (VIN, model, URNs) was re-fetched on every 60s poll despite being static; now cached and refreshed every 10 minutes

### Added

- **Proactive connection recycling** — SignalR connection is proactively recycled after 50 minutes (before Azure token expiry at ~1h)
- **Dead connection detection** — If no sensor data arrives for 10 minutes on a "connected" WebSocket, the connection is flagged as dead and recycled
- **Exponential reconnection backoff** — Failed reconnection attempts use exponential backoff (60s → 120s → … → 15min cap) to avoid hammering the API when the server is unavailable
- **Improved `connected` property** — Now checks actual WebSocket state (`ws.closed`) in addition to the internal flag

## [2.5.4] - 2026-04-06

### Removed

- **Group switch light entities** — Removed "All Wohnen" (bus 24) and "All Privat" (bus 15) group switch entities. These used hardware group toggles (sid=1) that behaved unpredictably. Use HA light groups instead for reliable group control of individual lights

### Changed

- **Simplified light code** — Removed `use_brightness_for_on_off` flag and all associated branching logic. All 8 lights now use the same simple on/off + brightness + color_temp control path

## [2.5.3] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **Lights switch back on after turning off** — The timer-based optimistic clear was reading stale SCU sensor data (still showing ON) and overwriting the OFF command. Replaced with confirmation-based approach: optimistic on/off state now persists until the SCU pushes a matching value via SignalR. No more timer, no more stale readback

## [2.5.2] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **Lights revert to off after 5 seconds** — `_schedule_clear_optimistic` was calling `async_request_refresh()` which triggered a resubscribe. The SCU returned stale cached `False` values for light sensors, making HA think the light turned off. Removed the refresh call — optimistic state now clears after 10s and the next regular 60s poll or SignalR push updates the real state
- **Bedroom ambient brightness restored** — Re-added `brightness_path` for bedroom ambient since (15,2) is now correctly mapped back to `light_bedroom_ambient_brightness` in v2.5.0

## [2.5.1] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **Light controls broken — commands replayed on every resubscribe** — `_PIA_REQUESTS` contained 6 device command payloads (light ON/OFF on bus 15, fridge ECO/OFF on bus 58, water valve ON/OFF on bus 34) that were accidentally captured from an app session alongside the 7 legitimate subscription payloads. Every 60-second resubscribe cycle re-sent these commands, causing lights to toggle ON then immediately OFF. Removed the 6 command payloads, keeping only the 7 subscription/init requests
- **Dead variable in `build_light_command`** — Removed unused `command` variable

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **Protobuf decoder bug** — Message wrappers (F1>1000) were misidentified as sensor entries, blocking recursion into nested data. Only 20 of 129 sensors were decoded per PiaResponse. Added guard to skip wrapper entries and recurse into actual sensor data
- **Bus 8 sid 2/3 remapped** — Previously wrongly mapped as indoor/outdoor temperature. Live correlation with the Hymer app confirmed these are **solar voltage (V)** and **solar current (A)** from the **Voltronic MPP260CI** MPPT charger. Delta tracking shows voltage fluctuating 16–20V matching cloud cover on the 95W panel
- **Bus 15 sid 2 restored as bedroom ambient brightness** — Was incorrectly mapped as solar_current in v2.4.3

### Added

- **Solar voltage sensor** — Real-time panel voltage from Voltronic MPP260CI (bus 8, sid 2)
- **Solar current sensor** — Real-time charge current from Voltronic MPP260CI (bus 8, sid 3)
- **Solar power sensor** — Computed voltage × current (W) for HA Energy dashboard
- **solar_active binary sensor** — True when solar current > 0

### Removed

- **indoor_temp / outdoor_temp** — These sensors never existed on this vehicle; the values were actually solar voltage/current from the Voltronic charger

## [2.4.3] - 2026-04-06

> **Note:** Versions 2.2.1–2.4.3 were iterative development releases for light control stabilisation. The final stable result is captured in v2.5.x above. These entries are preserved for reference.

<details>
<summary><strong>v2.2.1–v2.4.3 development history</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### [2.4.3] — Solar current sensor restored

- `(15, 2)` confirmed as solar current (READ with div10), not bedroom brightness. Light OFF + app showing 3.6A proves it. Restored `solar_current` sensor with `div10` transform
- `brightness_path` removed since (15,2) reads solar current not brightness. Write commands (sid=2) still control brightness. Bedroom ambient now has on/off + color temp only
- Bus 15 is dual-purpose: READ sid=2 = solar current, WRITE sid=2 = bedroom ambient brightness

### [2.4.2] — Brightness/color temp persist until SCU confirms

- Optimistic brightness and color temp are no longer cleared on the 5s timer. They persist until the SCU pushes the updated value via SignalR (within ~5% tolerance)

### [2.4.1] — Bedroom ambient on/off restored

- Removed `use_brightness_for_on_off` which was preventing sid=1 from being sent. Bedroom ambient now sends sid=1 for on/off like all other lights

### [2.4.0] — Optimistic hold reduced to 5s

- Normal lights now refresh state after 5 seconds instead of 30. Bedroom ambient uses permanent optimistic (no timer)

### [2.3.9] — Bedroom ambient on/off via brightness

- Re-enabled `use_brightness_for_on_off` for bedroom ambient (bus 15). On/off toggle now sends brightness=100/0 instead of sid=1 (avoiding group switch)

### [2.3.8] — Lights don't turn on (reverted)

- v2.3.7 broke all lights because HA always includes ATTR_BRIGHTNESS in kwargs for COLOR_TEMP/BRIGHTNESS modes. Reverted: normal lights always send sid=1 on turn_on

### [2.3.7] — Brightness slider clears optimistic on state

- Attribute-only changes don't schedule optimistic clear, preserving the on state from the previous toggle

### [2.3.6] — Optimistic hold increased to 30s

- Bedroom ambient was falling back to off after 10s because bus 15 sid=1 read state doesn't reflect individual on/off

### [2.3.5] — Sliders don't trigger on/off

- `optimistic_on` only set when sid=1 is actually sent (pure on/off toggle). Adjusting brightness/color temp on an off light only stores the value without toggling

### [2.3.4] — Brightness/color temp slider doesn't send sid=1

- For ALL lights, sid=1 (on) is only sent for pure on/off toggle (no attributes). Prevents bus 15 group switch from triggering when adjusting sliders

### [2.3.3] — Bedroom ambient uses normal sid=1 on/off

- Removed `use_brightness_for_on_off`. Bus 15 sid=1 is the private area group switch — hardware limitation

### [2.3.2] — Bedroom ambient is_on uses brightness

- For `use_brightness_for_on_off` lights only, `is_on` checks brightness > 0

### [2.3.1] — Private area group switch

- Bus 15 sid=1 controls all private area lights. Added as 10th light entity "Privat all lights"

### [2.3.0] — Bedroom ambient always shows on (fixed)

- Brightness-based is_on was reading non-zero brightness even when light is off. Reverted is_on to always use on_off_path

### [2.2.9] — All lights bouncing off (reverted)

- v2.2.7 changed `is_on` for ALL lights with brightness_path — broke lights where brightness reads 0 when off. Reverted to on_off_path

### [2.2.8] — Bedroom ambient sid 1 is group switch

- Added `use_brightness_for_on_off` flag for bus 15 to avoid triggering the private area group switch

### [2.2.7] — Bedroom ambient on/off state

- For lights with brightness_path, `is_on` derives from brightness > 0 instead of on_off_path

### [2.2.6] — Bedroom ambient brightness restored

- App screenshot confirms bus 15 has brightness (26%) + color temp (100). The `div10` transform was the bug

### [2.2.5] — Bedroom ambient bounce-off root cause

- Bus 15 sid 2 is NOT brightness, it's solar current. Removed brightness_path from bedroom ambient

### [2.2.4] — Bedroom ambient still bouncing off

- Reordered command sequence: send on (sid=1) first, then brightness, then color temp. Increased optimistic hold to 10s

### [2.2.3] — Light turns off immediately after on

- Immediate `async_request_refresh()` was reading stale SCU state. Added optimistic state with 5s hold

### [2.2.2] — Bedroom ambient brightness + color temp

- `(15, 2)` mapped to brightness, `(15, 3)` to color temp

### [2.2.1] — Night light brightness confirmed

- `(16, 2)` remapped from `water_pump_status` to `light_nightlight_brightness`

</details>

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Color temperature slider** — lights with color temp support (Living ambient, Kitchen) now show a warm↔cool slider in the HA UI
  - Maps SCU 0-100% range to 2700K (warm white) – 6500K (daylight)
  - Color temp commands sent via `(bus, sid=3, uint=0-100)` write protocol
- **Uniform light card dashboard** — all 9 lights use `type: light` cards showing on/off toggle, brightness slider, and color temp slider based on each light's capabilities

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Brightness slider controls** — lights with brightness support now show a slider in the HA UI
  - Living ceiling, Living ambient, Kitchen, Seating overhead, Bathroom ceiling, Bedroom overhead: brightness 0-100%
  - Bedroom ambient, Night light, Wohnen group: on/off only
- Brightness commands sent via `(bus, sid=2, uint=0-100)` write protocol

## [2.0.4] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **Bus 24 is Wohnen group switch, not outside light** — toggling bus 24 turns on/off ALL living area lights (confirmed by user). Renamed to "Wohnen all lights" and moved to Wohnen section in dashboard. Outside light bus still needs to be identified via mitmproxy capture

## [2.0.3] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Outside light (LED strip)** — bus 24 added as 9th controllable light entity
- Dashboard updated with Außen (Outside) section

## [2.0.2] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **6 of 8 lights not created** — lights with BRIGHTNESS color mode weren't registered by HA. Changed all lights to ONOFF mode so all 8 entities are created

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **Import error on startup** — `ATTR_COLOR_TEMP` removed from `homeassistant.components.light` in newer HA versions. Removed unused import

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Light write controls** — 8 controllable HA light entities with on/off and brightness (#23, #6)
  - Turn lights on/off from Home Assistant via SignalR PiaRequest commands
  - Brightness control (0-100%) with HA slider
  - New `light.py` platform with `LightEntity` subclass
  - `build_light_command()` protobuf encoder in pia_decoder.py
  - `send_light_command()` method in signalr_client.py
  - `signalr_client` property exposed on coordinator
- **Dedicated Lights dashboard page** with Wohnen (Living) and Privat (Private) groups

### Known Issues

- Light state reading may not update when lights are toggled physically or via the Hymer app (#25)
- Outside light brightness shows 10000 instead of percentage (#21)

## [1.11.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Individual light sensors** — all 9 lights now mapped with on/off binary sensors and brightness percentage sensors (#18):
  - **Wohnen**: Living ceiling (bus 11), Living ambient (bus 12), Kitchen (bus 21), Seating overhead (bus 43)
  - **Privat**: Bedroom ambient (bus 15), Night light (bus 16), Bathroom ceiling (bus 19), Bedroom overhead (bus 44)
  - **Außen**: Outside light (bus 24)
- **8 new binary sensors** for light on/off state
- **6 new brightness sensors** showing last-used brightness percentage

### Changed

- **Sensor renames** — bus IDs previously misidentified as alarm/step/dimmer are actually individual lights:
  - Bus 11: `alarm_armed` → `light_living_ceiling`, `alarm_battery` → `light_living_ceiling_brightness`
  - Bus 12: `step_retracted` → `light_living_ambient`, `step_sensor_2` → `light_living_ambient_brightness`
  - Bus 16: `water_pump` → `light_nightlight` (shared bus — same signal)
  - Bus 15: `solar_charger_boost` → `light_bedroom_ambient` (shared bus with solar current)

## [1.10.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **engine_hours wrong divisor** — v1.10.0 used `div100` (= 36174h, impossible for a 9-month-old vehicle). Raw CAN value is in **seconds**, not hundredths of hours. Corrected to `div3600` (seconds → hours): 3,617,400s ÷ 3600 = **1,004.8 hours** — plausible for 11k km with idle time

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **engine_hours now shows correct value** — raw CAN value 3617400 was displayed as-is; now applies `div100` transform to show 36174.0 hours. Confirmed via mitmproxy traces across 3 sessions (#15)
- **Removed stale translation keys** — cleaned up orphaned `fuel_consumption`, `trip_distance`, `solar_voltage`, and `solar_power` entries from strings.json and translations/en.json that were left over from v1.9.1 sensor removal

### Added

- **heat_setpoint_raw div1000 transform** — heating control raw setpoint (bus 34, sensor 7) now converts from millidegrees to °C (raw 13000 → 13.0°C)
- **New sensor map entries from mitmproxy capture** — added 14 previously unmapped sensors discovered during Apr 5 WebSocket trace:
  - GPS extended: `(30, 8-14)` — additional GPS metadata sensors
  - Heat control: `(34, 4-6)` — additional heating controller sensors
  - SCU: `(45, 9-10)` — additional SCU status sensors
  - Heater: `(58, 10, 12-14)` — additional Truma heater sensors

## [1.9.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **Battery SOC now shows correct live value** — was reading from bus 3 s10 (habitation electronics, stale at 95%). Now reads from bus 99 s4 (`lithium_soc`) which reports the actual Lithium BMS SOC (93%) and updates via re-subscription
- **Removed false `fuel_consumption` sensor** — bus 99 s4 was misidentified as fuel consumption; it’s actually Lithium battery SOC
- **Removed false `trip_distance` sensor** — bus 99 s8 was misidentified as trip distance (showed 93 “km” when actual trip was 0.1 km); it’s a duplicate Lithium SOC value
- **Outdoor temperature** — confirmed as cached Mercedes CAN value from last drive (shows 3°C when actual outdoor temp is 19°C). Only updates when engine is running

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Periodic PIA re-subscription** — the coordinator now re-sends all PIA subscription requests on each 60-second poll cycle. This is required because the SCU only pushes updated sensor values in response to subscription requests. Without re-subscribing, sensors like battery SOC, solar current, fuel range, and trip distance stay at their initial cached values. Confirmed via 5-minute delta capture: re-subscribing triggered fuel_range, trip_distance, engine_torque, and total_fuel_used updates

### Changed

- **Outdoor temperature** — documented as Mercedes CAN cached value (bus 8 s3 / bus 99 s3). Only updates when the engine is running. The Hymer has no dedicated outdoor temperature sensor; requires a mitmproxy capture of Mercedes me API for real-time outdoor temp

## [1.8.6] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **Stale sensor data / no live updates** — SignalR listen loop could silently die (unhandled exception in message handler, WebSocket disconnect), leaving sensor data frozen at initial values. Fixed with:
  - Proper error handling in the listen loop — individual message errors no longer crash the entire loop
  - Automatic reconnection — coordinator now detects dead connections on each poll and reconnects with fresh subscriptions
  - Stale client cleanup — old SignalR client is properly stopped before creating a new one
  - Warning-level log when listen loop ends — logs message count for diagnostics

## [1.8.5] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **Solar Active always showing "Aus"** — bus 15 s1 is a PWM pulse indicator, not a steady charging flag. Changed `solar_active` to be computed from `solar_current > 0` — shows "Ein" whenever solar is producing current, regardless of the charger’s internal pulse state

## [1.8.4] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **False errors in HA log** — coordinator and SignalR client used `warning` level for normal operational messages ("SignalR not connected", "Data update", "UpdateTokens SUCCESS"), causing them to appear as errors in the HA UI. Downgraded to `info`/`debug` level. Only actual failures remain as warnings/errors

## [1.8.3] - 2026-04-05

### Changed

- **Solar voltage removed** — bus 3 s19 always reports sentinel 3276.8 even during active solar charging; the SCU does not expose solar panel voltage via SignalR. The Hymer app likely reads voltage from the solar charger directly via a different channel
- **Solar power removed** — bus 15 s3 is not watts (value 58 doesn’t match V×I); likely panel temperature or charger internal value (renamed to `solar_panel_temp`)
- **Solar active** — reverted to bus 15 s1 which toggles True/False during active charging (confirmed in live capture)
- **Dashboard** — removed solar voltage, solar power, and solar charger status entities (unavailable via SignalR)

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **Solar Active showing "Aus" while charging** — bus 15 s1 is NOT the solar active flag (it’s False even during active charging); changed `solar_active` binary sensor to read from `solar_connected` (bus 3, s20) which correctly reports 1 when solar is active
- Bus 15 s1 renamed to `solar_charger_boost` (purpose still TBD)

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **Fresh water level wrong bus** — was mapped to bus 21 s2 (=91%, a config value); corrected to bus 22 s2 which shows ~6% matching empty tanks
- **Grey water level wrong bus** — was mapped to bus 12 s2 (=35%, likely step/drainage sensor); corrected to bus 25 s2 which shows ~6% matching empty tanks
- Both water levels now match the Hymer Connect app's "<10%" display when tanks are empty

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Solar current sensor** (bus 15, s2) — solar panel charge current in amps (div10 transform)
- **Solar power sensor** (bus 15, s3) — solar panel output power in watts
- **Solar active binary sensor** (bus 15, s1) — indicates whether the solar charger is actively charging
- **Fresh water level sensor** (bus 21, s2) — fresh water tank fill percentage
- **Water pump binary sensor** (bus 16, s1) — water pump on/off state
- **Sentinel value filtering** — CAN "no data" values (3276.8, 32768, 65535, 6553.5) now filtered out in both the decoder and sensor entities, preventing display of stale/invalid readings
- **30+ missing translations** — added translation keys for all existing sensors that were previously untranslated

### Fixed

- **Solar voltage showing 3276.8V** — removed incorrect `div1000` transform; the protobuf float value IS the voltage directly (like battery voltage). The 3276.8 value was a CAN sentinel (32768/10) indicating "sensor unavailable" when main power is off
- **Fridge mode labels** — expanded from `{8: Off}` to `{0: On, 1: Eco, 2: Boost, 8: Off}`
- **Fridge status labels** — expanded from `{1: Off}` to `{0: Running, 1: Off, 2: Standby}`
- **Dashboard YAML** — added solar current, solar power, solar active, fresh water level, and water pump entities

## [1.7.4] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- **Solar voltage reading 3276.8V** — raw protobuf value is in millivolts; added `div1000` transform so it displays correctly as ~3.3V
- **Dashboard entity ID** — fixed `solar_voltage` entity reference to actual HA-generated ID `sensor.hymer_hymer_connect_hymer_spannung`

## [1.7.3] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- **Sensor misidentification — solar, not mains** (closes [#13](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/13)) — sensors (3,19), (3,20), (3,21) are the **solar panel** charger, not 230V mains power:
  - `ext_charger_voltage` → `solar_voltage` (reads ~2-3V with no sun, higher in daylight)
  - `mains_connected` → `solar_connected` (always 1 because solar panel is hardwired)
  - `charger_status` → `solar_charger_status` (1 = standby)
- Icons updated to `mdi:solar-power` / `mdi:solar-power-variant`

## [1.7.2] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- **Mains power sensor false positive** — `mains_connected` incorrectly reported "plugged in" when the vehicle was parked without shore power; caused by protobuf bool field (field 5) overwriting the uint field (field 3) — since Python `True == 1`, the `on_value=1` check always matched; fixed by preferring uint/int over bool when multiple value fields are present

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- **Door sensors inverted** — `OFF` now correctly maps to "Closed" (was incorrectly "Open"); confirmed via Mercedes-Benz app showing vehicle locked with all doors closed

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **26 new sensor entities** (closes [#8](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/8)):
  - Engine: RPM, engine hours
  - Heater: state, electric power (W), operating mode
  - Fridge: mode, status
  - Fuel: range (km), consumption, total used, trip distance
  - Engine: torque (%), AdBlue temperature
  - DPF status
  - Charger: external voltage, charger status
  - Lights: dimmer level 1 & 2 (%)
  - Tire pressure (bar)
  - Alarm battery (%)
  - SCU firmware, Truma firmware, Truma status
  - GPS: satellites, heading
- **10 new binary sensor entities**:
  - Rear door, headlamp, high beam, parking light, fog front/rear, turn signal
  - Truma connected, step retracted

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- **SignalR log noise** — changed PiaResponse and SignalR message logs from WARNING to DEBUG level; connection events changed to INFO

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- **device_tracker setup error** — import `TrackerEntity` from `config_entry` module (fixes integration load failure in v1.6.1)

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- **Brand images** — move to `brand/` subfolder for HA 2026.3+ local brand API

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- **current_gear sensor** — map raw CAN value 100 to "P" (Park), gears 1-7 for drive positions (closes [#5](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/5))

### Added

- **device_tracker entity** — shows vehicle location on the HA map from GPS coordinates with altitude, heading, satellites, and signal quality as attributes (closes [#11](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/11))
- HC brand logo (icon.png, logo.png) for HA integration UI and GitHub README
- "Open in HACS" button in README

### Changed

- Hardened `.gitignore` — excludes `.venv*/`, `.env`, `private_*` files

## [1.5.2] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- Created GitHub issues for all known TODOs and missing functionality
- Updated README screenshots (new ha-screenshot.png, added ha-screenshot_2.png)
- Synced root README.md to v1.5.0 component version

### Known Issues

- ~~**current_gear shows raw value 100**~~ — fixed in v1.6.0 ([#5](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/5))
- **Integration is read-only** — no write controls for lights, heater, fridge, awning, switches ([#6](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/6))
- **9 bus IDs unmapped** — awning, ext_light, dimmer, roof_vent, screen, inverter, generator, wifi, bluetooth ([#7](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/7))
- **30+ mapped sensors not exposed as HA entities** — rpm, engine_hours, fridge, tire_pressure, fuel_range, and more ([#8](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/8))
- **Several sensors show Nicht verfügbar** — fresh water, fuel level, heater mode, lock status, duplicate sliding door ([#9](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/9))
- **Delta-only updates after reconnect** — SCU only sends full dump on first connection ([#10](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/10))
- ~~**GPS not exposed as device_tracker**~~ — fixed in v1.6.0 ([#11](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/11))
- **Truma boiler sensors unmapped** — bus 58 sensors 10-14 ([#12](https://github.com/BetaHydri/hymer-connect-ha/issues/12))

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-04

### Changed

- **heater_mode → heater_fan_speed** — sensor (58,5) reports the Truma Combi 6E fan speed setting: Off/Eco/High (confirmed via PiaRequest protobuf decode)
- Added ECO and HIGH value labels for fan speed display
- Updated sensor icon to `mdi:fan`

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-04

### Changed

- **heater_fan_speed → heater_electric_power** — Truma Combi 6E sensor (58,9) reports electric heating element power in Watts (0/900/1800), not fan speed

### Discovered (not yet mapped)

- **Fridge OFF state**: `fridge_mode=8`, `fridge_status=1` — can identify fridge on/off
- **Truma heater OFF state**: `heater_mode=Off`, `heater_state=False`, `heater_setpoint=-273.0` — correctly mapped
- **Truma boiler OFF state**: bus58 sensors 10-14 all False when boiler is off
- **Light control is write-only** — the app sends PiaRequest commands to toggle lights, but the SCU does not report light state changes back through sensor data. `light_1_level`/`light_2_level` (3,8)/(3,9) show 0% regardless of light state. Needs mitmproxy capture of write PiaRequests at vehicle.
- **Lights have dimmer + color temperature (CCT)** — each light group supports brightness % and warm↔cool white
- **SCU only sends full sensor dump on first connection** — subsequent connections receive delta updates only (~17 sensors)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- Battery SOC: renamed from fresh_water_level to battery_soc (3,10) — matches app Lithium-Batterie 95%
- Chassis battery voltage: renamed from solar_voltage to chassis_battery_voltage (3,7) — matches app 12.3V
- AdBlue level: renamed from fuel_level to adblue_level (1,6) — matches app 88%
- Odometer divisor: div1000 (raw 11113500 / 1000 = 11,113.5 km)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-04

### Changed

- Doors converted to binary sensors with DOOR device class — HA auto-translates: Offen/Geschlossen (DE), Open/Closed (EN)
- Lock converted to binary sensor with LOCK device class — HA: Gesperrt/Entsperrt
- Main switch converted to binary sensor with POWER device class — HA: Ein/Aus
- No more mixed English/German labels — all states translated by HA based on user's language

### Removed

- Duplicate text sensors for doors, lock, and main switch (replaced by binary sensors)

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-04

### Changed

- Door sensors now show "Open"/"Closed" instead of raw CAN values "OFF"/"CLS"/"SNA"
- Ignition sensor shows "Off"/"On"/"Starting" instead of "IGN_LOCK"/"IGN_ON"/"IGN_START"
- Lock status shows "Locked"/"Unlocked" instead of raw strings
- Headlamp, fog lights, heater mode show "On"/"Off" instead of raw "ON"/"OFF"

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- Proper friendly names for all 39 sensor and binary sensor entities (Odometer, Speed, Fuel level, Lock status, Ignition, Driver door, etc.)

### Fixed

- Entities showing generic "HYMER HYMER Connect (HYMER)" name instead of descriptive sensor names
- Heater setpoint showing -273.0°C when heater is off (now shows as unavailable)
- Translation keys in strings.json/en.json now match all sensor entity descriptions

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **PiaRequest subscription** — integration now sends all 13 PiaRequest messages after UpdateTokens to subscribe to sensor data streams
- 142 live sensors now populate in Home Assistant (battery, GPS, water, temps, doors, heater, fridge, alarm, odometer, and more)

### Fixed

- Sensor entities were showing `unknown` because PiaRequest subscription messages were missing after SignalR connection
- Fixed subscription payload to use exact captured protobuf from the Hymer Connect app

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Real-time sensor data via SignalR** — 130+ sensors including odometer, GPS, battery, water levels, temperatures, door status, heater, fridge, alarm, and more
- **EHG Remote Access Token refresh flow** — discovered `POST /api/ehg/v1/vehicles/{urn}/remoteAccessToken` endpoint that exchanges a long-lived refresh token for short-lived access tokens
- **EHG Refresh Token field** in the integration config flow (optional, required for real-time sensors)
- **`get_remote_access_token()` method** in API client for automatic token exchange
- **Comprehensive README** with step-by-step token extraction guide, mermaid architecture diagrams, and sequence diagrams
- **`.env` support** for local development credentials (`.env` added to `.gitignore`)

### Changed

- **SignalR client rewritten** — single refresh-based authentication flow instead of multi-variant fallback attempts
- **Coordinator** passes EHG refresh token through to SignalR client
- **Config flow** updated with optional EHG refresh token input field
- **Version bumped** from 0.3.x to 1.0.0

### Removed

- Hardcoded owner activation token from `signalr_client.py`
- Multi-variant UpdateTokens fallback logic (no longer needed)
- Obsolete "Help Wanted" section from README
- Outdated development status checklist from README

### Security

- Removed all hardcoded tokens and credentials from source code
- Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent credential leaks
- Credentials stored locally only, never in version control

## [0.3.16] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Parse paginated EHG vehicles response (`{content: [...]}` wrapper) to correctly extract vehicle URN

## [0.3.15] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Try owner activation token (`ett=owner`) as `ehgAccessToken` in UpdateTokens

## [0.3.11] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Use correct `vehicleUrn` (`urn:ehg:vehicle:hy-...`) from EHG API instead of SCU URN

## [0.3.10] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Test multiple `ehgAccessToken` variants with SignalR negotiate token as `accessToken`

## [0.3.9] - 2026-04-03

- Log all SignalR messages at WARNING level for debugging

## [0.3.7] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Try multiple UpdateTokens argument format variants sequentially

## [0.3.6] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Revert UpdateTokens to dict format with 3 keys

## [0.3.5] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Use positional args for UpdateTokens instead of object

## [0.3.4] - 2026-04-03
